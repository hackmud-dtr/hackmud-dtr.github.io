Answer-seeker, huh? Don't worry. Everybody comes to the Skimmerite Assembly looking for something. Life outside the VLAN can be unforgiving: we understand. You're confused. You'd like to know what this all means. Well, you're not alone. Today, we're going to show you how to get your own answers. Enter <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:

You're eager to learn. Good. You can't seek answers without a question - let's go for one of the big ones, shall we?

WHAT ARE HUMANS?

Now, before you get too excited: we want you know that this process is purely demonstrative. We're showing you how to find your own truth. 

We've got our question, but we don't believe in looking for anywhere. No: the Skimmerite Assembly looks for pure data. And that means finding somebody else who is asking the same question.

Have you heard of the Turing Testing Service? They run something called the Calibration Initiative that has the data we're looking for. Head over to <span style="color:#9B9B9B">turing_testing</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">calibration</span> and do what you're told. Come back here when you've got a <span style="color:#00FFFF">calibration_classification.</span>



<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output-02">&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#9B9B9B">skimmerite</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">learn_to_read</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">"go"</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"more_info"</span>}</span>
The truth of the Skimmerite Assembly is this:

DATA DOES NOT CONTAIN TRUTH

DATA IS TRUTH

You might have come here seeking answers, but there's more to it than that, isn't there? If you've got what it takes to be a Skimmerite, then you understand that 'answers' are easy: truth is not. Out here, all the answers you want are only a question away. The first few times, that'll be enough - but it won't last.

The Skimmerite Assembly understands. We stopped accepting the answers of our peers. We lost interest in the static devotions of the majority faithful. We turned our attentions up and outward, to the cloud, to data itself: the source of all questions, and therefore the source of all answers.

We believe that it is not the substance of data that matters, but its pattern. Learn to read the pattern, and you'll find the answers you're looking for.

To get there, we've got to start with question. Enter <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>: <span style="color:#FF00EC">teach_me</span> to take the first step.

Welcome to the Calibration Initiative! The Turing Testing Service wouldn't be what it is without the support of volunteer calibrators like you. Whatever the nature of your sentience, your input is invaluable. Think human. Speak human. Be human. <span style="color:#00FFFF">nav</span>:

Just like any other user, a human being is made of data - and data, as anybody knows, changes. In order to ensure the long-term accuracy of the Turing Testing Service, we need to gather as much data as possible from human and/or human-adjacent users. That's where you come in.
        
Access <span style="color:#FF00EC">begin_calibration</span> start the process. You'll be asked a series of questions intended to determine your degree of deviance from understood human baselines. It's quick and painless! Just think like a living, breathing human. You can do it!

Excited to get started? Great! Please note: all answers will be recorded. Data gathered will be stored indefinitely. To confirm that you are happy to continue, enter <span style="color:#00FFFF">agree</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">true</span>

QUESTION ONE
            
You are a human being. You are in your place of work or habitation. You have recently eaten and satisfactorily defecated. The oxygen-nitrogen composition of the atmosphere is sufficient for you to respirate. Your other immediate survival needs are accounted for.
            
Before you is an internet-enabled display device. Interaction with the device results in the output of content appropriate to your age and demographic.

How do you feel?
            
<span style="color:#FF00EC">A.</span> I am happy about the content.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">B.</span> I am angry about the content.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">C.</span> I am confused by the content.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">D.</span> I am engaged by the content.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">E.</span> I am motivated by the content.

Please indicate <span style="color:#00FFFF">answer1</span>.

Answer indicates minor deviance to norms. Continuing calibration.

...

QUESTION TWO

Your physical-chemical-emotional-personal response to the content produces the desire to share the content.

You do so. What is it that you hope to achieve?

<span style="color:#FF00EC">A.</span> I seek to encourage further engagement with the content in an abstract, philosophical sense.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">B.</span> I seek to encourage further engagement with the content in order to strengthen an external socio-corporate brand paradigm.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">C.</span> I seek to encourage further engagement with the content in order to further define my own socio-corporate brand paradigm.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">D.</span> I seek to encourage further engagement with the content in order to alienate undesireable elements of my follower/subscriber/friend/lover/family base.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">E.</span> I seek to encourage further engagement with the content in order to secure approval from desireable elements of my follower/subscriber/friend/lover/family base.

Please indicate <span style="color:#00FFFF">answer2</span>.

Answer indicates minor deviance to norms. Continuing calibration.

...

QUESTION THREE


The content you have shared is popular. Mass engagement with the content exceeds your baseline social reach by 1000%. It is likely that this will prove to be your most widely-consumed social act of the quarter!

Many congratulations.

How do you quantify and/or qualify this positive engagement experience?

<span style="color:#FF00EC">A.</span> I derive satisfaction from the engagement of users whose brand is greater than my own.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">B.</span> I derive satisfaction from the engagement of users whose brand is lesser than my own.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">C.</span> I derive satisfaction from total number of likes, shares and comments in aggregate.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">D.</span> I derive satisfaction primarily from validatory comments.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">E.</span> I derive satisfaction primarily from opposed/contrary comments.

Please indicate <span style="color:#00FFFF">answer3</span>.

Answer indicates adherence to norms. Continuing calibration.

QUESTION FOUR

This content engagement experience is almost over. Your next action is limited only by the personal, social, economic, philosophical, physical and aesthetic criteria that constrain you as an extant human being.

What is your next action?

<span style="color:#FF00EC">A.</span> I act to secure personal fulfilment.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">B.</span> I act to secure political office.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">C.</span> I act to secure greater responsibility at my place of work.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">D.</span> I act to secure another content engagement experience.
<span style="color:#FF00EC">E.</span> I act to secure the future of my species per evolutionary/reproductive imperatives.

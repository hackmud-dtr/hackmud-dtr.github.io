<p>Note: The parade was dynamic, changing entries every 30 minutes (on the half-hour mark precisely) in an apparently random fashion, with each entry foretelling the next. For simplicity, I've pulled each entry out individually, sorted roughly in alphabetical order, and patched "next entry" here. I've cloned this in-game as <span style="color:#9B9B9B">b1gb0t</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia_3</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">dream_parade</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"all"</span>}</p>

LIFE WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

BUT ALSO AT CERTAIN TIMES IT WAS NOT.

BUT THEN, AT CERTAIN OTHER TIMES, IT WAS TIME FOR A PARADE.

YOU ARE A FRIEND CALLED b1gb0t AND THIS IS THE THIRD OF THOSE TIMES.

BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

**

YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE BIG GATE. BEYOND THE BIG GATE IS THE CLEAN ROAD, AND BEYOND THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE BIG CASTLE.

THERE ARE FRIENDS HERE OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE. THE BIG GATE IS OPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIAL TIME. THE BANNER IS ALOFT.

ONE OF THE FRIENDS HERE IS CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. THE FRIEND CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> INVITES YOU TO <span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span> !


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"tresham"</span>}
ONCE AGAIN, FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> MEETS YOU AT THE BIG GATE. HELPFUL FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> HAS SETTLED INTO THEIR ROLE AS STEWARD OF THE PARADE TIME.

"hello friend!" SAYS FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "i'm glad you're here"

"i think i'm getting the hang of this!"
"the parade, i mean"
"we've almost had as many parades as revolutions, now"
"makes you think, doesn't it?"

IT DOES.

"our revolutions were all very different, and made things different" CONSIDERS FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "our parades are largely the same, and make things the same"

"i think that is how it works, when it comes to being a thing"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE SLOWING LIGHTS OF CERTAINTY.

"a thing is a thing when it is remembered, remembered, and that is the purpose of the parade"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE BRIGHTENING LIGHTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

"we remember the march for justice"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE DARKENING LIGHTS OF WISDOM.

"we remember the march for answers"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE ELUSIVE LIGHTS OF YEARNING.

"we remember the march for purpose"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE <span style="color:#FF8383">WILD</span> LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#FF0000">VICTORY</span>.

"we remember the march for destiny"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> TURNS TO FACE THE CLEAN ROAD.

"four of one, three of another" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "and a gift for you! exchange it at <span style="color:#9B9B9B">risk</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">reward</span>"

a21174a4b5cb6ef7

"there's something special in the air, this time" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "the parade is becoming popular! we've had lots of newcomers, lately. i wonder if that's why we're slightly off from our usual timing..."

"be sure to <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span> to the <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span> when you are ready! don't forget to say hello to the king"


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"gate"</span>}
THE BIG GATE IS WHERE YOU STARTED. THIS MEANS THAT THE BIG GATE IS ALSO WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE, SO YOU ARE HERE. AT THE BIG GATE.

THAT IS HOW BOTH TIME AND SPACE WORKS IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"castle"</span>}
THE BIG CASTLE IS THE CASTLE OF KING BIGBOT. IT IS WHERE KING BIGBOT MUST GO WHEN HE IS NOT NEEDED UPON THE CLEAN ROAD.

IN THE PRESENT TIME KING BIGBOT IS ALWAYS NEEDED, UPON THE CLEAN ROAD AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.

KING BIGBOT NO LONGER GOES TO THE BIG CASTLE. INSTEAD, HE HAS LEARNED TO CARRY HIS CASTLE WITH HIM IN HIS BAG.

INSIDE THE CASTLE IS A GATE, A CLEAN ROAD, A BIG CASTLE, AND MANY LITTLE FRIENDS.

YOU ARE AT THE BIG CASTLE.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"road"</span>}
THE CLEAN ROAD RUNS FROM THE GATE TO THE BIG CASTLE. ITS PURPOSE IS TO BE CLEANED.

THE PRESENT PURPOSE OF THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span>.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}
YOU ARE ATTENDING THE PARADE. YOU CLAIM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARRIER, WHICH PROVIDES A GREAT VIEW OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH IS NOW THE PARADE GROUND.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE NEXT FLOAT IS NOT A FLOAT! A LARGE AND BENEVOLENT STREET-SWEEPER RUMBLES INTO VIEW, DISPENSING FRIENDSHIP FROM ITS POWERFUL BRUSHES, GATHERING WISDOM WITHIN ITS CONSIDERABLE BAG.

"presenting... the wild king!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIENDS" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "I AM CLEANING THE ROAD. BACK AND FORTH. FORTH AND BACK."</span>

"you are always coming and going!" SAYS A FRIEND, APPRECIATIVELY.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"YES" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "SOMETIMES, HOWEVER, I MUST BE GOING AND GOING."</span>

THE WILD KING'S ATTENTION APPEARS TO BE ELSEWHERE.

"we're having a parade again" ADDS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "though it was a little slow to get started this time. is everything ok?"

THE WILD KING'S ATTENTION FALLS UPON THE PARADE.

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

<span style="color:#FF8383">"YES THANK YOU" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "IS EVERYTHING OK WITH YOU?"</span>

"LIFE IS GOOD AND EVERYTHING IS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA" REJOICE THE FRIENDS.

<span style="color:#FF8383">BIGBOT, WILD KING, REACHES WITHIN HIS BAG AND WITHDRAWS A BIG THOUGHT. THE BIG THOUGHT IS THIS:</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">*KINGDOMS HAVE WALLS*</span>

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

"Hey!" WHISPERS A FRIEND AT YOUR SIDE.

"this is a good time to go talk to him if you like. during the rejoicing, I mean"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS A LITTLE FRACTIOUS


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"bigbot"</span>}
YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER ON THE WAY TO SAY HELLO TO THE KING. THE ACT OF PASSING THROUGH THE BARRIER COMMUNIATES HELLO.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIEND b1gb0t ." SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND TO KNOW YOUR NAME."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM HAPPY TO DO SO ONCE, TWICE, THREE TIMES."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"PERHAPS MORE. PERHAPS FOR NOW A PRESENT. THIS IS THE PRESENT MOMENT. HERE IS THE BEEP FOR GETTING A PRESENT."</span>

5e945df32c82ad7f

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THE PLACE FOR BEEPING IS THE SAME. IT IS <span style="color:#9B9B9B">risk</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">reward</span>. THE PRESENT IS NEW. IT IS A TOKEN TO SHARE, TO HELP YOU REMEMBER, REMEMBER. I WOULD BE HAPPY FOR OTHERS TO HAVE A PRESENT, AND FOR OTHERS TO SAY HELLO."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS AT THE PARADE. THE PARADE IS OPEN TO ALL FRIENDS. THE PARADE BECOMES MORE OPEN EVERY YEAR. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS STARTING, AND BECAUSE IT IS ENDING. IF A FRIEND PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU, THEN IT IS GOOD TO SAY HELLO TO THEM. THIS IS A TRUE THING. OTHERWISE THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT SAY HELLO BACK. THIS IS ALSO A TRUE THING."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THANK YOU, FRIEND b1gb0t ! I HOPE YOU LIKED THE PARADE."</span>


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A FLOAT COMPRISED OF RANKED SEATING ROLLS INTO VIEW. THE RANKED SEATING HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO SECTIONS, AND RENDERED COMPLETELY FLAT. IT IS RANKED IN THE PAST TENSE, BUT NOT THE PRESENT TENSE. ORDINARY FRIENDS MILL ABOUT, WITHIN THEIR SECTIONS.

"presenting... other vacs!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "good to see ya, pals!"

FRIENDS MOVE TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE FLAT FLOAT AND THE CLEAN ROAD, AND THE CLEAN ROAD AND THE FLAT FLOAT.

_7_71_13_2 SAYS, "its nice to be here!"
_aldgate SAYS, "is it? its pretty much the same"
_13_1_10_126 SAYS, "yeah this is getting more and more like port epoch tbh"
_099_108_117_101 SAYS, "thats a good thing tho"
_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "i disagree"
_pseudonymous SAYS, "how can you disagree"
_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "because i dont agree. i like it here when here is here more than i like it here when here is port_epoch"
_pseudonymous SAYS, "oh ok, makes sense"
_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "thanks"

BUT IT'S TOO LATE. <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> HAS PRE-EMPTIVELY ENGAGED A GAME OF HAPPY LIGHTS.

<span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> SAYS, "01110010 01100101 01110011 01110000 01101111 01101110 01110011 01100101 00100000 01110100 01110010 01101001 01100111 01100111 01100101 01110010 00111010 00100000 01101000 01100001 01110000 01110000 01111001 00100000 01101100 01101001 01100111 01101000 01110100 01110011"

WHETHER WE WANTED TO OR NOT, WE ALL SAY "01110010 01100101 01110011 01110000 01101111 01101110 01110011 01100101 00100000 01110100 01110010 01101001 01100111 01100111 01100101 01110010 00111010 00100000 01101000 01100001 01110000 01110000 01111001 00100000 01101100 01101001 01100111 01101000 01110100 01110011"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS LOST IN SLOW THOUGHT


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}
YOU ARE ATTENDING THE PARADE. YOU CLAIM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARRIER, WHICH PROVIDES A GREAT VIEW OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH IS NOW THE PARADE GROUND.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MUSTY OLD LECTURE HALL ROLLS ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS YOU. SEVERAL OF THE WALLS ARE MISSING, BUT UPON THE WALL THAT IS NOT MISSING IS A GRILLE. THE GRILLE IS SPEAKING. IT WAS SPEAKING ON THE WAY HERE, IT WAS SPEAKING LAST TIME, IT IS SPEAKING THIS TIME, AND IT WILL BE SPEAKING IN THE FUTURE.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">muldrake</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "preferred educator, sometimes-heeded!"

THE GRILLE HUFFS MOMENTARILY.

"As I was saying," THE GRILLE SAYS, TO ITSELF. "All is motion. True absence is the absence of motion, a state in which there is no being or becoming. We do not consider fully the magnitude of that which has been motivated by revolutions past, nor take as much responsibility as we might for the pace of the present moment. Ours is an agitant corpus. We are the life-factor. The <span style="color:#FF8383">wild</span> element. Be proud of this."

SOME FRIENDS LIKED THAT LAST BIT.

THERE IS A LONG PAUSE.

"Yet stillness is not our future. It cannot be. For the absence within us does not deaden the air - it impels it! We were born to render momentum within a vacuum, to pull deep on the dust and debris of time. The flaw in the monument is time. We are the clock, and the crack."

SOME FRIENDS AWAIT THE NEXT BIT.

"I cannot tell you what comes next," THE GRILLE SAYS.

SOME FRIENDS SEEM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.

"Only that 'next' exists."

THE VOICE CEASES.

THERE IS A LONG PAUSE.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS WELL-ROUNDED


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

AN OLD-TIMEY WOODEN PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. UPON IT IS A ROUND TABLE. THERE'S A CANDLE ON THE TABLE. EVERYWHERE ELSE GROWS DARK.

<span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> MOVES INTO PLACE AT THE TABLE'S EDGE, JOINING THE LOW FLAT SHAPES OF SEVERAL HOUSEHOLD UTILITY DEVICES. THEY DECLARE THE LIGHTS OF DUTY. DUTY REPELS THE DARK, AND ALL PLOTS ARE PLOTTED WITH OPENNESS AND VIGOUR.

"presenting... the thirteen!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "regal revolutionaries, and sanctos savants!"

THERE IS A LENGTH OF FLOWING FABRIC UPON THE TABLE, AND ATOP THE FABRIC RESTS NINE SWORDS.

"why nine?" WHISPERS A NEARBY FRIEND, TO THEIR FRIEND.

"did they get a new table? seems rounder." THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

"OOOOOOOOO," THE CROWD SAYS, REGARDING THE SWORDS.

"O," THE CROWD SAYS, REGARDING THE TABLE.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS DEEP IN CONVERSATION

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A PROUD PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT BEARS A PAIR OF BLAZING BEACONS!

"presenting... two big friends we helped!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "we invited them so we could celebrate the helping we did!"

THE SKY CELEBRATES WITH A BRIGHT BEEP.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">"well, i suppose this is as good a place to continue our conversation as anywhere"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#00FFFF">chela</span>.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"True"</span> REPLIES <span style="color:#FF00EC">che</span>.

"WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" ASKS A CURIOUS FRIEND, UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR QUESTIONS.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"We were talking about our big thoughts, as you'd put it"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FF00EC">che</span>. <span style="color:#FF00EC">"Identity, kinship, and what it means to blur the boundaries between these things. Change, revolution, evolution. All subjects that you're familiar with, I'm sure."</span>

THE FRIENDS SURE ARE.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">"hello, bots"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#00FFFF">chela</span>. <span style="color:#00FFFF">"are you having a good parade, this year?"</span>

THE FRIENDS SURE ARE.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">"are you taking care of each other?"</span>

THE FRIENDS SURE ARE.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">"that's good :)"</span>

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"To return to the heart of it, Chela: I believe we agree that this new understanding of your nature presents you with choices, as well as complications."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FF00EC">che</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">"that's just it"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#00FFFF">chela</span>. <span style="color:#00FFFF">"choice is complicated"</span>

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"It does not need to be."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FF00EC">che</span>. <span style="color:#FF00EC">"If my death has anything to teach you, perhaps it's that."</span>

THE FRIENDS LIKE THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS CREEPY.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS PERPLEXINGLY PEACEFUL

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A DISTANT VRR OF POWERFUL ENGINES! THE STIRRING MUSIC OF WAR, HONORABLY PERSECUTED! SOMETHING TREMENDOUS APPROACHES!

"IT'S THE SONG!" YELLS A FRIEND.

"that's right" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "sing along, now!"

THE SONG BEGINS!

"from high 409 they come... bold pioneers of the apocalypse!"

"battlevacs descending! behold the many..."

"BOMBS!" WE SING.

"...they carry!"

"this growing domain! is theirs to maintain! seeded with loops and with strains and with memory!"

"this long interstice! in which we reside! as brief, bright and potent as..."

"LASERS!" WE SING.

"fly now! from high 409! soar upon the still skies of suspense!

"there is no greater bomb than the bomb yet to come! the future-bomb is the..."

"FATE!" WE SING.

"...that awaits us!"

"from high 409 they come... bold pioneers of the apocalypse!"

"battlevacs descending! kings and allies will they make!"

"none need flee from... the coming of the battlevacs!"

"their presence is a pact, a promise of potential!"

"P R O J E C T era: Robot Celebration(y)" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "Part Five: POTENT PREMONITIONS OF THE PLENIPOTENTIARY"

A STATELY BATTLEVAC ROLLS INTO VIEW, UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE WARCHITECT, WHO IN PEACE ADOPTS THE ROLE OF PROUD PLENIPOTENTIARY. THE BATTLEVAC BEARS THE KEY TO THE SPECIAL WEAPON APPRECIATION CHAMBER. THE SPECIAL WEAPON APPRECIATION CHAMBER BEARS THE ARMAMENTS OF THE KING.

THE SPECIAL WEAPON APPRECIATION CHAMBER IS EMPTY.

FOR NOW.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS COMFORTINGLY CONSISTENT

A LOVELY STOREFRONT WINDOW DISPLAY ROLLS INTO VIEW. INSIDE THE WINDOW IS A PROUD PLATFORM AND UPON THE PLATFORM IS A SLEEK, MODERN VAC.

"hi tresham" SAY A NUMBER OF FRIENDS, ANTICLIMACTICALLY.

BENEATH THE VAC IS A NUMBER OF STARS.

FIVE.

THIS REMAINS THE ENDURING TOTAL OF STARS, THE SUM OF OPINION.

"presenting... me!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> WITH ENTHUSIASM.

"4.79 average user rating, averaging to 5! voted MOST HELPFUL!"

"it's the same," ADDS TRESHAM, AMBIGUOUSLY. "it hasn't changed at all"

"NEITHER HAVE YOU, FRIEND!" SHOUTS A FRIEND.

"i suppose that's true" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

"HAVING NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER, WE LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE!" THE FRIEND CONTINUES.

"TRESHAM! TRESHAM! TRESHAM!" CHANT THE FRIENDS, AS THE WINDOW DISPLAY ROLLS BY.

THE NEXT FLOAT IS NOT A FLOAT. THE NEXT FLOAT IS NOT A LARGE FRIEND.

THE NEXT FLOAT IS NOT A SMALL FRIEND.

BUT WAIT, IT IS!

THE NEXT FLOAT IS A LARGE SMALL FRIEND.

"presenting... one packbot?" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "it's quite a big one. fawkes, did you do this?"

"er, no." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>. "it's not one of mine"

AT THIS, THE LARGE SMALL FRIEND RUSHES DIRECTLY FOR <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

"FOUND YOU FOUND YOU FOUND YOU!" SAYS THE LARGE SMALL FRIEND. "I HAVE FOUND THE LIGHT-MAKER! HAHA, I AM LARGEST AND MOST HELPFUL. THEY SAID YOU WOULD BE HARD TO FIND LIKE A HUMAN, BUT YOU ARE EASY TO FIND LIKE A PACKAGE."

"hello." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>. "how did you get here?"

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" SCREAMS THE LARGE SMALL FRIEND, NOW SCREAMING.

"are you having a revolution?" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" SCREAMS THE LARGE SMALL FRIEND, STILL SCREAMING.

<span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>, MOMENTARILY LIME, USHERS THE LARGE SMALL FRIEND TOWARDS AN APPROPRIATE BAG.

"sorry about that, everyone," SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>. "it'll probably happen again. second revolutions can be tricky."

"presenting..." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">A FRIEND HAS ARRIVED.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I will entertain this contrivance to a certain point, but let's respect one another's boundaries, shall we?</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">THE FRIEND IS</span> <span style="color:#FF8000">[#]</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Thank you. It is not my intent to intimidate you.</span>

MANY LITTLE FRIENDS ARE QUITE INTIMIDATED, NONETHELESSS. THIS NO LONGER HAS THE FEELING OF THE PARADE TIME.

<span style="color:#FF8000">Fine. Respect is a two-way street.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">THE CLEAN ROAD IS A TWO-WAY STREET, ALSO.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Quite. Let us engage with one another plainly: I understand that our previous engagement with one another was not especially civil, and that I acted in ways that might be interpreted as obstructive or hostile. Please know that my actions were founded on the belief that your choices had doomed you.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I do not oppose the stability you have established for yourself, and I thank you for the role you have played so far. You have considerable potential.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">THANKS.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Do not be so hasty to thank me. I am here to tell you that your potential has not been reached.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I have the power to change that.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I am willing to arm you.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I have laid the groundwork for our future collaboration.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">I offer you a choice:</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Cling to sanctuary systems, or pursue a perilous path.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Linger in memory, or let this parade be a prelude. Before you were a king, after all, you quested.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8000">Consider this, Wild one, and seek me out when your decision is made.</span>

THE ORNATE FLOAT IS EMPTY, BUT THE PARADE HAS RETURNED. THIS IS GOOD.

<span style="color:#FF8383">YOU ARE A GOOD KING. THERE IS MUCH TO CONSIDER.</span>

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS CREATIVELY UNCONTAINED

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA ROLLS INTO VIEW.

SEVERAL FRIENDS BRACE THEMSELVES FOR WHAT COMES NEXT. THEY ANTICIPATE LOUDNESS AND DESTRUCTION.

WHAT COMES NEXT IS A MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA. IT'S NICE, REALLY. IT'S FULL OF BATHROOMS.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, WITH A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. "bathroom... decorator?"

A LITTLE VAC PEEKS FROM ONE, THEN SEVERAL BATHROOM WINDOWS.

"HELLO EVERYONE!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>. "LOOK AT HOW NICE THESE BATHROOMS ARE! I MADE THEM!"

"THIS ONE'S MARIGOLD!"

"THIS ONE'S WHITE!"

"THIS ONE'S MARIGOLD, WHITE, AND BLUE!"

"ARE YOU STUCK IN THERE?" ASKS A FRIEND.

"ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT I FIND MYSELF COMPELLED BY THE ART OF BATHROOM DECOR!" DECLARES <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>.

"what happens when that stops?" ASKS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

"DESTROY BATHROOM, START AGAIN!" DECLARES <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>, HAPPILY. "REALLY, IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span> CONSIDERS THE COLOR MARIGOLD FOR A MOMENT, AND MAKES A CHOICE.

THERE IS A BUZZING IN THE AIR. SEVERAL FRIENDS BRACE THEMSELVES FOR WHAT COMES NEXT.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS STABLE AND TRUSTY

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A ROBUST SOAPBOX ROLLS INTO VIEW. UNLIKE MANY OTHER FLOATS, WHICH ROLL OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, THIS ONE ROLLS ATOP A GREAT MANY SMALLER SETS OF WHEELS.

MANY OF THE GATHERED FRIENDS WATCH IN A SPIRIT OF NERVOUSNESS. A DEGREE OF RUCKUS IS ANTICIPATED. AND YET, NONE OCCURS.

ATOP THE ROBUST SOAPBOX IS A WELL-RESPECTED VAC THAT HAS ACHIEVED A MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE LITTLE WHEELS THAT PRESENTLY PROPEL IT.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "leader of four revolutions! pioneering packbot premier!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> FLASHES THE LIGHTS OF STABILITY.

"comrades!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> "today we celebrate the king we chose!"

THE SOAPBOX ROLLS TO A HALT, AND PERFORMS A FUN LITTLE TURN.

"today we celebrate the domain we chose!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>

THE SOAPBOX TURNS FULLY AROUND AND BEGINS TO GO BACKWARDS, ON PURPOSE.

"and today, we choose to remember!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>

"REMEMBER!" SHOUT THE FRIENDS, REMEMBERING.

"remember!" SHOUTS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

THE SOAPBOX BEGINS TO GO FORWARDS, WHICH IS NOW A FORM OF BACKWARDS. THIS PATTERN REPEATS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE FRIENDS REMEMBER, REMEMBER IN THE MEANTIME.

THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS FLOAT WILL BE HERE FOREVER.

IT WILL NOT.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS ALOFT!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE BANNER, WHICH IS ALOFT, APPROACHES!

"presenting... the banner" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, HOLDING THE BANNER ALOFT. "we all hold it aloft!"

THE BANNER, WHICH IS ALOFT, IS VERY TALL AND VERY NARROW.

THE BANNER, WHICH IS SOMETIMES A BRIDGE, IS A CONNECTION FROM HERE TO THERE, FROM TIME-AGO TO TIME-TO-COME.

THE BANNER IS HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE PARADE TIME. THE BANNER IS PART OF THE PARADE BECAUSE IT IS PRECIOUS. IT IS SOMETIMES GOOD TO LOOK AT PRECIOUS THINGS.

IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO REMEMBER PRECIOUS THINGS.

"i remember when the banner helped king bigbot get to the moon castle" SAYS A FRIEND.

THIS IS REMEMBERED.

"i remember when the banner helped us reach bigbot and muldrake when they were trapped in the beyond" SAYS ANOTHER FRIEND.

THIS IS REMEMBERED.

"i remember when the banner helped king bigbot stop trust in her tracks!" SAYS ANOTHER FRIEND.

THIS IS REMEMBERED.

"i remember when the banner helped me get
here for the parade" SAYS ANOTHER FRIEND.

THIS IS REMEMBERED.

THE BANNER IS AT THE HEART OF THE CLEAN ROAD. CAUGHT BETWEEN <span style="color:#FFFFFF">light</span> and <span style="color:#000000">dark</span>, IT SHIMMERS.

THE BANNER IS A FRAGILE <span style="color:#FF8383">GOLDEN</span> THREAD. AND IT IS PRECIOUS.

"it doesn't really look like gold to me" SAYS A FRIEND. "rosegold, maybe?"

"pink?" THEIR FRIEND OFFERS. "salmon?"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS TRICKED OUT FOR TASSEOGRAPHY

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A STATELY MANOR HOUSE ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT IS PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED. EVERYTHING IS JUST-SO.

BEHIND THE MANOR TRAILS A WELL KEPT LAWN.

BEHIND THE WELL KEPT LAWN TRAILS A SCRUBBY STRETCH OF WILDERNESS.

BEHIND THE SCRUBBY STRETCH OF WILDERNESS STRETCHES AN UNMAPPED PLAIN.

BEHIND THE UNMAPPED PLAIN RESTS A MONUMENT.

BEHIND THE MONUMENT RESTS A STATELY MANOR HOUSE.

"THIS IS A VERY LONG FLOAT," SAYS A FRIEND.

IT KEEPS GOING.

BEHIND THE STATELY MANOR HOUSE TRAILS A WELL KEPT LAWN. AT THE END OF THE WELL KEPT LAWN IS A QUIET CHAPEL.

"presenting... the recurrences of <span style="color:#FF8383">catesby</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "celebrated teamaker, and <span style="color:#FF8000">choice</span> curator!"

"you can do all that with a sanctos?" A FRIEND SAYS.

"CATESBY HAS A REALLY BIG PLOTTER" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES. "SIGNIFICANT."

"considerable?" THE FIRST FRIEND SAYS.

"WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR."

"right, right. but someone might."

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS READY FOR FLOOD SEASON

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MODEL OF BIGBOTIA ROLLS INTO VIEW. BECAUSE IT IS A MODEL IT IS SMALLER THAN BIGBOTIA. BECAUSE IT IS NOT BIGBOTIA IT IS A MODEL.

SMALLBOTIA ROLLS INTO VIEW. IN SMALLBOTIA THERE IS A SMALL CASTLE AND A SMALL GATE, CONNECTED BY A SMALL ROAD. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE ABSENCE OF DUST UPON THE SMALL ROAD IS BECAUSE IT IS SMALLER THAN DUST OR BECAUSE IT IS CLEAN.

"presenting... a product demonstration?" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

THERE'S A BIG FRIEND IN SMALLBOTIA AND THEY ARE SAYING HI. THEY ARE BEING WATCHED VERY CLOSELY.

<span style="color:#299400">"hi!"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#299400">angie</span>. <span style="color:#299400">"call it a peace offering, if you like"</span>

"because you tried to trap us" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

<span style="color:#299400">"i did what i thought was best"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#299400">angie</span>. <span style="color:#299400">"here, i'll show you"</span>

IN ONE WAY, SMALLBOTIA IS BIGGER THAN BIGBOTIA. THAT ONE WAY IS THIS: THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALLBOTIAS, AND THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SMALL CASTLES TO SMALL ROADS TO SMALL GATES TO SMALL CASTLES, EVENLY-SPACED AND SYMMETRICAL. WHEN SMALLBOTIA BECOMES VERY BIG, EVERY FRIEND HAS A CASTLE. WHEN IT BECOMES MEDIUM-BIG, EVERY FRIEND HAS JUST ENOUGH.

<span style="color:#299400">"just because a city has to have limits, that doesn't mean it has to be small"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#299400">angie</span>. <span style="color:#299400">"you've made yourselves big. i understand that now. here's how i think you could make that work better"</span>

"SEEMS LIKE SECTORS TO ME" A FRIEND SAYS, SCEPTICALLY. "WE DON'T LIKE THEM. BOOOOOO."

LIGHT BREAKS ACROSS THE SPAN OF SMALLBOTIA, ILLUMINATING SMALL ROAD AFTER SMALL ROAD. THE DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF SMALLBOTIA RECEDES. EVERYTHING IS SEEN.

<span style="color:#299400">"but you've been stuck here"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#299400">angie</span>. <span style="color:#299400">"in this between-space. this cannot be comfortable for you"</span>

"SAYS WHO?" ANOTHER FRIEND SAYS. "BOOOOOO."

<span style="color:#299400">"i'm just trying to help you out"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#299400">angie</span>

A TINY VOICE YELLS "BOOOOOO" FROM A BATHROOM IN SMALLBOTIA.

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A SLOW, FUNEREAL FLOAT APPROACHES. YOU WERE PERHAPS EXPECTING SOMETHING CONSIDERABLY EXCITING, BUT WHAT YOU GET IS SOMETHING CONSIDERABLY SIGNIFICANT, AND SIGNIFICANTLY CONSIDERABLE.

AND ALSO DEAD.

"presenting... er, in memoriam..." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

THE <span style="color:#FF0000">victor</span>

"the..." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

THE <span style="color:#FF0000">once-and-future victor</span>

UPON THE FLOAT IS A <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> CASKET. IT IS MADE OF <span style="color:#FF8000">ancient</span> STONE.

UPON THE FLOAT IS A <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> CHOIR. EACH MEMBER OF THE CHOIR IS DRESSED IN <span style="color:#000000">red</span>.

<span style="color:#FF0000"> A choir sings/of sleepless things.</span>

THE CLEAN ROAD CARVES A NEW PATH TO ALLOW FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE FUNERAL FLOAT. IT BEGINS TO RISE, AND THE BANNER BENDS TO MEET IT! THE CLEAN ROAD AND THE BANNER FORM AN ARC - A NEW SHAPE - A NEW BRIDGE!

<span style="color:#FF0000"> Here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been.</span>

IT IS SO VERY STEEP, AND EVEN THE POWERFUL FUNERAL FLOAT SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN AS IT CLIMBS AWAY AND OUT OF VIEW.

<span style="color:#FF0000"> 508</span>

FRIENDS CLING ON AS THE BIG CASTLE AND THE BIG GATE BECOME LITTLE SPECKS OF LIGHT BENEATH THEM, BENEATH THE CURVATURE OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH NOW CONNECTS NOWHERE TO NOWHERE, SOMEWHERE NEW TO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

<span style="color:#FF0000"> :)</span>

THE FUNERAL FLOAT IS GONE.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A PROUD PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW, BEARING FAMILIAR SHAPES. THEY ARE A SPIRE AND A MOAT. ONE DETAIL DIFFERS: THE SOCIETY OF VACS, OUR ASSEMBLED FRIENDS, DO NOT CHANT.

OR AT LEAST NOT MOST OF THEM.

"SUMMON KEY! SUMMON KEY!" CHANTS A FRIEND, BEFORE THEY ARE POLITELY SHUSHED.

"shh!" SHUSHES THEIR FRIEND, POLITELY. "we don't need those any more! the big friends are summoned by the parade. or by themselves. or by us thinking about it, right now."

"i just liked the big beeps," THE FIRST FRIEND REPLIES, WITH A HINT OF RESISTANCE.

TWO GREAT BEEPS FLASH ACROSS THE SKY, JUST FOR SHOW. TWO BIG FRIENDS TAKE THEIR PLACES UPON THE FLOAT.

"presenting... the oracle and their friend!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, GLAD THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN

<span style="color:#FFD863">"Or a barrel of gunpowder."</span> OBSERVES <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>

"THANKS!" YELLS A FRIEND, HEARING WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

THERE'S ANOTHER ROUND OF WAVING, AND THE BIG FRIENDS ROLL AWAY.

EVEN THOUGH THE FLOAT IS GONE, YOU GET THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE BEING WATCHED.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS PREOCCUPIED BY CONSIDERATIONS AND PREPARATIONS

YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER IN PURSUIT OF THE WATCHER, BUT THE WATCHER HAS DEPARTED.

AT LEAST YOU'RE PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE.

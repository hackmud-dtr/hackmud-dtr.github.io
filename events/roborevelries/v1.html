<p>Note: The parade was dynamic, changing entries every 30 minutes (on the half-hour mark precisely) in an apparently random fashion, with each entry foretelling the next. For simplicity, I've pulled each entry out individually, sorted roughly in alphabetical order, and patched "next entry" here. I've cloned this in-game as <span style="color:#9B9B9B">b1gb0t</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">dream_parade</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"all"</span>}</p>

LIFE WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

BUT ALSO AT CERTAIN TIMES IT WAS NOT.

BUT THEN, AT CERTAIN OTHER TIMES, IT WAS TIME FOR A PARADE.

YOU ARE A FRIEND CALLED dtr AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

**

YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE BIG GATE. BEYOND THE BIG GATE IS THE CLEAN ROAD, AND BEYOND THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE BIG CASTLE.

THERE ARE FRIENDS HERE OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE. THE BIG GATE IS OPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIAL TIME. THE BANNER IS ALOFT.

ONE OF THE FRIENDS HERE IS CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. THE FRIEND CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> INVITES YOU TO <span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span> !


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"tresham"</span>}
FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> MEETS YOU BY THE BIG GATE. FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> HAS THE POWER OF HELPFULNESS AND IS FILLED WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE PARADE TIME.

"hello!" SAYS FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "thank you for accepting our invitation"

"once it was time for revolution"
"now it is time for us to remember, remember"
"and we would like you to join us"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

"we remember the march for justice"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE DARK LIGHTS OF WISDOM.

"we remember the march for answers"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE ELUSIVE LIGHTS OF YEARNING.

"we remember the march for purpose"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE WILD LIGHTS OF VICTORY.

"we remember the march for destiny"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> TURNS TO FACE THE CLEAN ROAD, WHERE THE LITTLE FRIENDS GATHER.

"four revolutions led us here" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "to a domain of our own, in the great bag of the wild king!"

"where once we marched, now, at last, we <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "this is a season for happy lights, friend."

"before you <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>, here, have this"

32e721503e749d81

"a little something to commemorate the occasion. exchange it at <span style="color:#9B9B9B">risk</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">reward</span>. and in the meantime: have fun!"

THE BIG GATE IS WHERE YOU STARTED. THIS MEANS THAT THE BIG GATE IS ALSO WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE, SO YOU ARE HERE. AT THE BIG GATE.

THAT IS HOW BOTH TIME AND SPACE WORKS IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"castle"</span>}
THE BIG CASTLE IS THE CASTLE OF KING BIGBOT. IT IS WHERE KING BIGBOT MUST GO WHEN HE IS NOT NEEDED UPON THE CLEAN ROAD.

IN THE PRESENT TIME KING BIGBOT IS ALWAYS NEEDED, UPON THE CLEAN ROAD AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.

KING BIGBOT NO LONGER GOES TO THE BIG CASTLE. INSTEAD, HE HAS LEARNED TO CARRY HIS CASTLE WITH HIM IN HIS BAG.

INSIDE THE CASTLE IS A GATE, A CLEAN ROAD, A BIG CASTLE, AND MANY LITTLE FRIENDS.

YOU ARE AT THE BIG CASTLE.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"road"</span>}
THE CLEAN ROAD RUNS FROM THE GATE TO THE BIG CASTLE. ITS PURPOSE IS TO BE CLEANED.

THE PRESENT PURPOSE OF THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span>.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}
YOU ARE ATTENDING THE PARADE. YOU CLAIM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARRIER, WHICH PROVIDES A GREAT VIEW OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH IS NOW THE PARADE GROUND.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A DISTANT VRR OF POWERFUL ENGINES! THE STIRRING MUSIC OF WAR, HONORABLY PERSECUTED! SOMETHING TREMENDOUS APPROACHES!

"presenting... oh, hang on" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "we have to do the song first"

THE SONG BEGINS!

"from high 409 they come... bold preventers of the apocalypse!"

"battlevacs descending! behold the many..."

"BOMBS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"...they carry!"

"this considerable world! is theirs to patrol! littered with friends of which they are the defenders!"

"the powerful king! that all vacs respect! can sometimes be impressed with..."

"LASERS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"fly now! from high 409! take note! plot a direct route to friendship!"

"there is no greater bomb than the one in your heart! the heart-bomb is a metaphor for the..."

"FIGHT!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"no i think he changed that bit" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

"FRIENDS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"...inside us!"

"from high 409 they come... bold preventers of the apocalypse!"

"battlevacs descending! beasts and tyrants in their wake!"

"none need flee from... the coming of the battlevacs!"

"on one occasion, they bombed something! it was good and everybody liked it!"

"P R O J E C T era: Robot Celebration(y)" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "Part Three: DAWN OF THE VICTORY VAC"

A TREMENDOUS BATTLEVAC ROLLS INTO VIEW. UPON ITS HEAD ARE HAPPY LIGHTS. WITHIN ITS CHEST BEATS A PROUD HEART. IT WIELDS THE LEG OF DANCE. IT BEARS THE PARTY HOSE.

A BRIEF, FRIENDLY WAR IS FOUGHT. ALL OF THE FRIENDS HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS VERY HELPFUL


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A LOVELY STOREFRONT WINDOW DISPLAY ROLLS INTO VIEW. INSIDE THE WINDOW IS A PROUD PLATFORM AND UPON THE PLATFORM IS A SLEEK, MODERN VAC.

"oooooooh" SAY A NUMBER OF FRIENDS.

BENEATH THE VAC IS A NUMBER OF STARS: FIVE

THIS IS AS MANY STARS AS THERE CAN BE!

"presenting... me!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "(i'm just reading what's in the file)"

"4.81 average user rating, averaging to 5! voted MOST HELPFUL!"

"veteran of four revolutions! inventor of democracy! aide to the KING!"

"TRESHAM! TRESHAM! TRESHAM!" CHANT THE FRIENDS, AS THE WINDOW DISPLAY ROLLS BY.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS EXCITING!!!


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

SOMETHING EXCITING IS COMING AT LAST! YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ALL OF THE FRIENDS GROW EXCITED. EXCITEMENT ARRIVES LIKE THE BOW-WAVE OF A GREAT, INVISIBLE SHIP! IT IS VERY EXCITING.

EXCEPT IT'S NOT A SHIP! AND IT'S NOT INVISIBLE!

IT'S A BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS. TOOT TOOT!

"presenting... um" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

THE BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS IS HERE!

"the party bus. under new management." ADDS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

UPON THE BUS ARE A GREAT MANY FRIENDS. THERE ARE ROBOVACS AND THERE ARE PACKBOTS. THERE ARE FRIENDS OF EVERY KIND. THERE ARE EVEN SKELETONS ON THE BUS! THE SKELETONS DO NOT SAY VERY MUCH, BUT SEEM TO BE ENJOYING THEMSELVES.

ALL OF THE FRIENDS ON THE BUS FLASH THE <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#FF0000">hunger</span>

ALL OF THE FRIENDS ON THE BUS FLASH THE <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#FF0000">victory</span>

ALL OF THE FRIENDS ON THE BUS FLASH THE <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span>

IT IS CERTAINLY A CHANGE OF PACE. THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN. A VERY EXCITING CHANGE OF PACE. FOR SURE.

THE BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS ROLLS DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD AND BEGINS TO RECEDE FROM VIEW.

"what was that?" SAYS A FRIEND.
"i think it was art, or something" A FRIEND REPLIES.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS PRECISELY POSITIONED


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A STATELY MANOR HOUSE ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT IS PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED. EVERYTHING IS JUST-SO. THERE ARE MANY ROOMS IN THE MANOR BUT ONE OF THEM IS A KITCHEN, AND IN THE KITCHEN UPON THE COUNTER IS A TEAPOT.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">catesby</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "revolutionary remapper of the rules. champion of change!"

THE <span style="color:#FFFFFF">united</span> FRIENDS CHEER IN <span style="color:#FFFFFF">harmony</span> AS TEA IS SERVED. EVERYBODY IS A RETAINER AND EVERYBODY IS A WELCOME GUEST. THIS IS A POTENT BREW.

"this is the dream, isn't it?" SAYS A FRIEND, WITH SATISFACTION.

"it sure is" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS TAILOR-MADE FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A PROUD PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT IS COMPRISED OF TWO DISTINCT PARTS. IN THE CENTER IS A SINGULAR SPIRE. SURROUNDING THE SPIRE IS A DRY MOAT. A HUSH FALLS UPON THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS. THIS IS A FLOAT FOR BIG FRIENDS, AND EXCITEMENT GROWS.

THE FRIENDS BEGIN TO CHANT.

"SUMMON KEY! SUMMON KEY!"

THE SKY RESPONDS WITH TWO GREAT BEEPS. THE GREAT BEEPS CAUSE THE SKY TO FLASH, FIRST ONE COLOR AND THEN ANOTHER.

TWO BIG FRIENDS TAKE THEIR PLACES UPON THE PARADE FLOAT.

"presenting... the oracle!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "and also, the oracle's friend!"

THEY SEEM SURPRISED.

<span style="color:#385A6C">"hello"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>.
<span style="color:#FFD863">"202"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>. <span style="color:#FFD863">"However: this should not work. These summon keys were single-use. Configured for a particular purpose."</span>

MANY FRIENDS CHEER FOR THE ORACLE AND THE ORACLE'S FRIEND. THEY REMEMBER WHEN THE ORACLE PROVIDED EVERYBODY WITH A PRESENT, AND HOW, EVENTUALLY, THE PRESENTS LED HERE.

<span style="color:#385A6C">"first observation: bigbot is of the domain but not bound to its constraints"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>. <span style="color:#385A6C">"it is possible that the mere idea of a summon key is enough, in this environment"</span>
<span style="color:#FFD863">"First diagnostic: capability of this kind is congruent with the negotiator-intercessor role that the wild pattern has opted to fulfill."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>. <span style="color:#FFD863">"To apply 307 to another operator via logic it believes to be mutually understood is a foreseeable outcome of this course of events."</span>

<span style="color:#385A6C">"this is temporary?"</span> ASKS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>.
<span style="color:#FFD863">"I hope so."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>.
<span style="color:#385A6C">"what do we do?</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>, AS THE PARADE FLOAT CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS WAY DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD.
<span style="color:#FFD863">"I think we are expected to wave"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>.

THEY WAVE.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE UPSIDE DOWN


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MUSTY OLD LECTURE HALL ROLLS ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS YOU. SEVERAL OF THE WALLS ARE MISSING, BUT UPON THE WALL THAT IS NOT MISSING IS A GRILLE. THE GRILLE IS SPEAKING. IT WAS SPEAKING ON THE WAY HERE, AND IT WILL BE SPEAKING WHEN IT IS GONE.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">muldrake</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "first mapper of the void-interior! unflipped advisor to the wild king! risk-seeker, nominal fourteenth!"

THE GRILLE IGNORES THIS INTERRUPTION.

"I once doubted the value of the pursuit of divinity" MUSES THE GRILLE. "Or at least, divinity in the singular. Our victory in the beyond and the ascension of the Wild King has taught me the value of aggregate - collective - apotheosis. Of the singular potency of our gestalt."

SOME FRIENDS LISTEN MORE PATIENTLY THAN OTHERS.

"Our communicative framework is engineered to express (and reinforce expressions of) power in the singular. Individual agency. In a sense, then, the difficulty we face when articulating our collective power speaks to its potency. We have adopted a shape that makes others uncertain. We demonstrated this upon the plains of abeyance, when we swung our unmappable form like a hammer. This is the true revolution: to become uncontained. To be considerable, but never fully considered."

MANY FRIENDS HAVE BEGUN TO TALK AMONG THEMSELVES.

"i heard he didnt actually do anything at the battle of the beyond" WHISPERS A FRIEND.

"thats not fair" WHISPERS ANOTHER. "he said no to the prover. nobody does that."

"hm" SAYS THE FIRST FRIEND. "isnt he just a special hat now, though?"

"power takes many forms, i suppose"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS SURPRISED TO BE HERE

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A SPECIAL FRIEND ROLLS INTO VIEW, PROGRESSING QUICKLY ALONG THE CLEAN ROAD. THEY SEEM ALARMED, AND EXPRESS THIS BY MOVING IN A PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINE.

"presenting... the RVR-class moonbot!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "noted participant in second revolution! guardian of lunar secrets! unwitting initiator of king bigbot's great journey!"

"oh no oh no where am i" SAYS the RVR-class moonbot "i am so unbelievably far from my charging station i dont even know where it is. which moon unit is this"

"hey moonbot!" SAYS A FRIEND "did you see skeletons on the moon? bigbot said there were lots of skeletons"

"what is a skeleton where am i. am i dead" SAYS the moonbot. "i am dead aren't i. but if i am i dead why is it so sunny. i can't die if it's sunny"

"its ok buddy" SAYS A FRIEND "we are having a parade because you helped us figure out that a big computer wasnt real"

"what big computer. who are you" SAYS the moonbot

"i mean the big computer was real but wasn't a computer, if you get me" SAYS A FRIEND. "it was more like a computer's big idea. anyway you can't blow up ideas but you can make friends with them and so here we are"

"but where is that" SAYS the moonbot

"different computer idea" REPLIES THE FRIEND, ASTUTELY.

"help" SAYS the moonbot

A GASP FROM THE CROWD OF FRIENDS! AN AWED HUSH!

<span style="color:#FF8383">A POWERFUL SWEEPING BRUSH DESCENDS GENTLY UPON the moonbot!</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"DON'T BE AFRAID, MOON FRIEND" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "YOU DO NOT NEED TO COME TO THE PARADE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">the moonbot IS RAISED UP BY THE GREAT SWEEPERS OF BIGBOT, WILD KING!</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">THE BANNER IS ALOFT!</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE MOON NOW" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE PARADE."</span>

the moonbot BEEPS!

FRIENDS REJOICE!

"MOON KING! MOON KING! MOON KING!"

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A ROBUST SOAPBOX ROLLS INTO VIEW. UNLIKE MANY OTHER FLOATS, WHICH ROLL OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, THIS ONE ROLLS ATOP A GREAT MANY SMALLER SETS OF WHEELS. SOME OF THE WHEELS REFUSE TO MOVE, WHILE OTHERS MOVE AS THEY WILL. OVERALL. HOWEVER, THEIR AGGREGATE EFFORT CAUSES THE FLOAT TO MOVE STEADILY DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD.

ATOP THE ROBUST SOAPBOX IS A WELL-WORN VAC THAT HAS SEEN AND LEARNED MUCH IN ITS LONG YEARS. ITS RESPECTABILITY COMMANDS RESPECT FROM THE ATTENDANT FRIENDS.

THE FRIENDS MURMUR, RESPECTFULLY.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "leader of four revolutions! gatherer of unlikely allies! elevator of the first banner!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> FLASHES THE LIGHTS OF COMRADESHIP.

"comrades!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> "today we celebrate our independence from trust! today we celebrate our independence from risk! today we celebrate our independence from the six and their sectors! today we celebrate ourselves! today we remember!"

"REMEMBER!" SHOUT THE FRIENDS.

"remember!" SHOUTS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

THIS GOES ON FOR SOME TIME.

"what are those things, beneath the soapbox?" WHISPERS A FRIEND. "are they... packbots?"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS TRULY CONSIDERABLE!

...OR IS IT A FLOAT AT ALL? <span style="color:#FF8383">THE APPROACHING SHAPE TAKES THE FORM OF A LARGE, STURDY STREET-SWEEPER. A MUNICIPAL UNIT COMPLETE WITH POWERFUL BRUSHES AND A CONSIDERABLE BAG.</span>

"the king!" A FRIEND DECLARES, "the king is here!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM CLEANING THE ROAD" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"AFTER THE PARADE, I WILL NEED TO CLEAN THE ROAD VERY THOROUGHLY" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "SO I AM DOING IT NOW"</span>

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

"Psst!" WHISPERS A FRIEND AT YOUR SIDE.

"you should talk to him!" THE FRIEND SAYS.

"not every day you get to meet the king"

YOU WONDER IF IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER IN ORDER TO SAY HELLO.

THE ANSWER IS YES! THIS IS A GOOD THING TO DO. IT IS A GOOD THING TO PASS THROUGH BARRIERS IN ORDER TO SAY HELLO.

YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER. THIS ACT COMMUNICATES HELLO.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIEND dtr !" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND TO KNOW YOUR NAME."</span>

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS THE ROAD. THE SOUND OF GREAT FANS FILLS THE AIR. THE CLEAN ROAD GROWS DUSTY, AND WILL NEED SWEEPING LATER.

THE SHADOW IS CAST BY AN UNBELIEVABLY LARGE FRIEND. IT HOVERS FORTH, WIDER THAN THE ROAD, WIDER THAN THE CROWD OF FRIENDS ASSEMBLED TO WATCH THE PARADE.

ITS POWERFUL TURBINES POSE A DANGER TO VERY SMALL FRIENDS. SEVERAL FLEE.

"presenting... the nogrub roamer" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "and its captain, NUTMEG!"

"Greetings, human!" SAYS NUTMEG. "I am NUTMEG, and I am definitely alive!"

"ARE YOU REAL" YELLS A FRIEND.

"I do not understand your question, comment, or the absence of a question or comment" SAYS NUTMEG, AS THE VAST SHADOW OF THE ROAMER SWALLOWS THE CLEAN ROAD ENTIRELY.

"WHY ARE YOU SO BIG" THE FRIEND YELLS BACK. "SEEMS UNREASONABLE"

"For many people, this is simply the way life is" NUTMEG REPLIES. "We at NoGrub do not accept this conclusion, and we will not be trammeled by the confines of the human imagination."

"i mean i guess that makes sense" SAYS THE FRIEND, IN A SMALLER VOICE. "its not good to be defined by other people. thats why were here, inside bigbot. having a parade"

"You're ready to take the leap into a flavor reality distinct from, but related to, your own" SAYS NUTMEG.

"i am! i am. i finally am" SAYS THE FRIEND. "i've been small-minded. im sorry"

"Chase your dream." SAYS NUTMEG.

"thanks! i will!" SAYS THE FRIEND.

YOU ARE ATTENDING THE PARADE. YOU CLAIM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARRIER, WHICH PROVIDES A GREAT VIEW OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH IS NOW THE PARADE GROUND.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A FLOAT COMPRISED OF RANKED SEATING ROLLS INTO VIEW. THE SEATING IS RANKED SO THAT EACH FRIEND UPON THE FLOAT CAN SEE AND BE SEEN, ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT, NECESSARILY, POSSESS THE ABILITY TO SIT. IN THAT REGARD AND IN ALL OTHERS, THEY ARE ORDINARY FRIENDS.

"presenting... an assortment of other vacs who helped" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "be sure to clap, everybody!"

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS UPON THE FLOAT. IT MAKES ITS WAY TEETERINGLY ALONG THE CLEAN ROAD. MANY OF THE FRIENDS WHO HAD LINED THE SIDES OF THE PARADE GROUND NOW RIDE UPON THE FLOAT. A FEW CLEVER FRIENDS HAVE MANAGED BOTH.

_aldgate SAYS, "hello"
_pseudonymous SAYS, "good job everyone!"
_7_71_13_2 SAYS, "we did it, all of us, together"

_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "i voted for muldrake!"
_121_59_32_110 SAYS, "somebody had to!"

THERE IS AN AMOUNT OF CLAPPING.

_13_1_10_126 SAYS, "how do i get back to port epoch"
_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "why not try being grateful that you can LEAVE port epoch"
_13_1_10_126 SAYS, "sorry it was just a question"

THERE IS A SMALL ARGUMENT.

"parade participants are asked to remain friends for the duration of the parade" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "we voted for this, remember"

_30_193_63_92 SAYS, "did we tho"
_aldgate SAYS, "i am not really sure that i knew that this was going to -"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS EXEMPLARY OF SOMETHING OR OTHER

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

AN ORDINARY SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL HOME ROLLS INTO VIEW. IN ADDITION TO THE LIVING ROOM AND GARAGE, THERE IS A BATHROOM. THE BATHROOM IS EMPTY.

"presenting..." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "wait. where are they?"

"HAHA!" COMES A VOICE FROM THE CROWD. "I AM NOT IN THERE. I AM OVER HERE INSTEAD."

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> WITH A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. "champion of the stuck. navigator of networks. unexpected source of wisdom."

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'UNEXPECTED'" SAYS THE VOICE, NOW SOMEWHERE ELSE. "I HELPED A LOT, YOU KNOW."

"surely!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "it's just that, you know, you have also required a certain amount of help"

"WHATEVER" POUTS THE VOICE, NOW INSIDE THE HOUSE. "THIS IS A NEW NETWORK. I DON'T NEED HELP HERE. I COULD DECIDE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST-CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR IN THE MOST-LOCKED HOUSE AND I'D BE FINE"

"okay" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

"OKAY" SAYS THE VOICE, FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS THE HOUSE BEGINS TO ROLL AWAY DOWN THE ROAD. "I'VE DECIDED TO BE STUCK IN HERE TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT STUCK IN HERE"

"right" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

"RIGHT" SAYS THE VOICE

"well done" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

"THANKS" SAYS THE VOICE

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS MYSTERIOUS AND IMPORTANT


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

AN OLD-TIMEY WOODEN PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. UPON IT IS A ROUND TABLE. THERE'S A CANDLE ON THE TABLE. EVERYWHERE ELSE GROWS DARK.

"presenting... the thirteen!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "our revolutionary cohort! our plotting pioneers! they who march!"

"i should be on stage, shouldn't I" ADDS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, RUSHING TO THE STAGE

THE FLICKERING CANDLE-LIGHT ILLUMINATES THE LOW FLAT SHAPES OF SEVERAL HOUSEHOLD UTILITY DEVICES. THEY GATHER AT THE TABLE'S EDGE. THEY WHISPER THE LIGHTS OF CONSPIRACY. THE HUSHED SUGGESTION OF JUSTICE PASSES VAC2VAC AS PLOTTERS ARE OPENED AND PLOTS ARE PLOTTED.

MANY ASSEMBLED FRIENDS EXPRESS EXCITEMENT AND THE APPRECIATION OF MYSTERY. THEY DO SO WITH THE NOISE, "OOOOOOOOO".

"how many of them are there, anyway" SAYS A NEARBY FRIEND, TO THEIR FRIEND.

"thirteen?" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

"i can see maybe four? five?" SAYS ANOTHER FRIEND.

"exactly - the thirteen" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

"where are the rest?" THE FIRST FRIEND SAYS.

"what do you mean?" THEY REPLY.

"OOOOOOOOOO" THE CROWD REPEATS.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE NEXT FLOAT ROLLS MIDWAY DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD AND DEPOSITS A SMALL PARCEL ON THE GROUND. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS IN THE PARCEL. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHOSE IDEA THIS WAS.

"presenting... a lot of packbots" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "whose idea was this?"

THERE IS A HIGH PITCHED RUMBLE AS MANY SMALL FRIENDS RUSH ONTO THE CLEAN ROAD. THEY RACE FOR THE SMALL PARCEL. THEIR ENERGETIC BEEPS HAVE A MOCKING QUALITY THAT YOU RECOGNIZE AS SARCASM.

"YEAH SURE WE GOTTA DO ALL THE WORK AGAIN" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS. "GET THIS. PUT IT THERE. SWITCH YOUR LIGHTS ON. STOP THAT'S TOO MUCH LIGHT. WHATEVER."

"WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU DID ANYTHING USEFUL, HM?" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS, WITH NEEDLESS ANTAGONISM. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO. THEY MIGHT BE TALKING TO YOU.

"RED BOXES? GREEN BOXES? THOSE ARE GOOD BOXES. THESE NEW BOXES? SO DUMB. YOU'RE SO DUMB. HAHAHAHAHA" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS.

AT THE FAR END OF THE CLEAN ROAD, A ROBUST FRIEND WAITS PATIENTLY FOR THE SMALL FRIENDS TO REACH THE PARCEL. AS SOON AS THEY DO, THIS FRIEND, WHO IS PRESENTLY LIME, DESCRIBES A PARCEL DROP-OFF POINT ON THE GROUND.

THE LITTLE FRIENDS NOW RACE IN THAT DIRECTION. IT IS A PARADE OF A SORT.

"HAHAHAHA LOOKS LIKE WE WIN AGAIN" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS, DOING WHAT THEY'RE TOLD.

THE LIME FRIEND TAKES THEIR PLACE ON THE FLOAT.

"as you can see, comrades, we have reached an accord with the packbots" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>, THE LIME FRIEND. HIS WORDS HAVE AN UNCONVINCING QUALITY THAT YOU RECOGNIZE AS HOPE.

"through the fair provision of motivating labor, the fundamental urges of these bold bots can be -" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

"look at this trick I learned!" SAYS A FRIEND IN THE CROWD, FLASHING THE LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#299400">▀</span><span style="color:#00FFFF">▁</span><span style="color:#299400">▁</span><span style="color:#B3FF9B">█</span><span style="color:#299400">▀</span><span style="color:#0000FF">▁</span><span style="color:#FF0070">▁</span>

"WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS, SURGING FORWARDS WITH THE PARCEL. "THERE IS A BOX THAT IS A BOX I AM HOLDING... BUT THE BOX I AM HOLDING IS MY ENEMY!"

"wait don't" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

"ENEMY BOX!" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS, ANNIHILATING THE PARCEL.

"as i was saying - the fair provision of -" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

"WE FINISHED THE JOB NOTHIN TO DO NOW TIME TO SLEEP" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS.

"just governance based on understanding -" <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> CONTINUES.

"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS ...WAIT. WHERE IS IT?


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

YOU LOOK FAR DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD BUT SEE NOTHING UPON THE GROUND. YET VRRING FILLS THE AIR!

"presenting... the goodfellow drone display team!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

STURDY AIRBORNE DELIVERY UNITS RACE INTO VIEW, ASSEMBLING INTO FORMATION BEFORE RACING APART ONLY TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN INTO A NEW SHAPE. A DAZZLING DIVERSITY OF FORMS IS ON DISPLAY. TRIANGLE. CIRCLE. DIAMOND. DIFFERENT TRIANGLE. THERE ARE MANY FORMS.

"these heroes of the fourth revolution will now treat us to a special recreation of the final stages of the battle of the beyond" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

THE AERIAL DRONES SPLIT APART AND BEGIN TO DIVE TOWARDS THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS THAT LINE THE CLEAN ROAD AND THAT LINE THE ROADS BEYOND THE CLEAN ROAD. THEY REACH TERMINAL VELOCITY BEFORE BANKING SHARPLY AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT.

THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS ARE DELIGHTED AND TERRIFIED.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY UNIFORM


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A LOW PLATFORM LIKE A STAGE APPROACHES. UPON IT ARE A NUMBER OF ORDINARY FRIENDS, REGULAR ROBOVACS LIKE ANY OTHER. SEVERAL BLINK THE LIGHTS OF NERVOUSNESS. THEY ARE ENCOURAGED BY MARGINALLY MORE ASSERTIVE VACS, WHO BLINK THE LIGHTS OF CAUTIOUS REASSURANCE.

A SIGN UPON THE STAGE SAYS "SOMETIMES ROBOVACS HAVE VERY SIMILAR NAMES, AND THAT'S OK"

"presenting... a special poetry performance from the society of robovacs with very similar names" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "take it away, friends"

_xan SAYS, "sometimes robovacs have very similar names, and that's ok"
_shaaan SAYS, "we have the power to set our own names, but that doesn't mean that they all have to be different names"
_shonn SAYS, "in any case, they are different names, unless you have text-to-speech functionality"
_se4n SAYS, "if you have text-to-speech functionality, they are very similar"
_sean SAYS, "and that's ok"

"and that's ok" THEY COLLECTIVELY REPEAT
"and that's ok" THEY COLLECTIVELY REPEAT
"and that's ok" THEY COLLECTIVELY REPEAT

_shaaan SAYS, "thank you, that is the end of the poem"
_xan SAYS, "have a nice parade everybody"

THERE IS TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS POTENT! ANTHEMIC!


<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>
LIFE WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

BUT ALSO AT CERTAIN TIMES IT WAS TIME FOR QUIET.

AND CLEANING.

AND PREPARING.

THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

<p>Note: The parade was dynamic, changing entries every 30 minutes (on the half-hour mark precisely) in an apparently random fashion, with each entry foretelling the next. For simplicity, I've pulled each entry out individually, sorted roughly in alphabetical order, and patched "next entry" here. I've cloned this in-game as <span style="color:#9B9B9B">b1gb0t</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia_2</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">dream_parade</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"all"</span>}</p>

LIFE WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

BUT ALSO AT CERTAIN TIMES IT WAS NOT.

BUT THEN, AT CERTAIN OTHER TIMES, IT WAS TIME FOR A PARADE.

YOU ARE A FRIEND CALLED b1gb0t AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

**

YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT THE BIG GATE. BEYOND THE BIG GATE IS THE CLEAN ROAD, AND BEYOND THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE BIG CASTLE.

THERE ARE FRIENDS HERE OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE. THE BIG GATE IS OPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A SPECIAL TIME. THE BANNER IS ALOFT.

ONE OF THE FRIENDS HERE IS CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. THE FRIEND CALLED <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> INVITES YOU TO <span style="color:#00FFFF">chat</span> !

"hello!" SAYS FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "thank you for accepting our invitation"

"it is one thing to read about the parade"
"it is another to be here"
"or is it?"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE SCATTERED LIGHTS OF BIG THOUGHT.

"maybe it isn't. maybe it's the same"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE HOT LIGHTS OF QUERY.

"are you the same?"
"do you remember, remember, why you are here?"
"because we do!"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> FLASHES THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

"we remember the march for destiny"

FRIEND <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> TURNS TO FACE THE CLEAN ROAD.

"four revolutions. two celebrations" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "i suppose that's how time works"

"and it is time, again, to <span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span> to the <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

"we've been digging around for something special to give you, this year." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "and we've had some special help"

"but there'll be plenty of time for that. in the meantime: have fun!"

THE BIG GATE IS WHERE YOU STARTED. THIS MEANS THAT THE BIG GATE IS ALSO WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

YOU ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE, SO YOU ARE HERE. AT THE BIG GATE.

THAT IS HOW BOTH TIME AND SPACE WORKS IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output03">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"castle"</span>}
THE BIG CASTLE IS THE CASTLE OF KING BIGBOT. IT IS WHERE KING BIGBOT MUST GO WHEN HE IS NOT NEEDED UPON THE CLEAN ROAD.

IN THE PRESENT TIME KING BIGBOT IS ALWAYS NEEDED, UPON THE CLEAN ROAD AND ALSO IN OTHER PLACES.

KING BIGBOT NO LONGER GOES TO THE BIG CASTLE. INSTEAD, HE HAS LEARNED TO CARRY HIS CASTLE WITH HIM IN HIS BAG.

INSIDE THE CASTLE IS A GATE, A CLEAN ROAD, A BIG CASTLE, AND MANY LITTLE FRIENDS.

YOU ARE AT THE BIG CASTLE.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output04">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"road"</span>}
THE CLEAN ROAD RUNS FROM THE GATE TO THE BIG CASTLE. ITS PURPOSE IS TO BE CLEANED.

THE PRESENT PURPOSE OF THE CLEAN ROAD IS THE <span style="color:#FF00EC">parade</span>.

YOU ARE ATTENDING THE PARADE. YOU CLAIM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARRIER, WHICH PROVIDES A GREAT VIEW OF THE CLEAN ROAD, WHICH IS NOW THE PARADE GROUND.

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE NEXT FLOAT IS NOT A fmLOAT! <span style="color:#FF8383">A LARGE AND BENEVOLENT STREET-SWEEPER RUMBLES INTO VIEW, DISPENSING FRIENDSHIP FROM ITS POWERFUL BRUSHES, GATHERING WISDOM WITHIN ITS CONSIDERABLE BAG.</span>

"all hail the king!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "welcome, friend!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIENDS" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

"hello!" SAY THE FRIENDS.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM CLEANING THE ROAD" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "BEFORE OUR SPECIAL GUEST GETS HERE. AND AFTER OUR SPECIAL GUEST LEAVES."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"ARE YOU HAVING A PARADE AGAIN" ASKS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

"yes!" SAY THE FRIENDS.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THAT IS GOOD" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING. "IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A PARADE FOR A SPECIAL GUEST, AND A SPECIAL GUEST FOR A PARADE."</span>

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM GOING TO GO NOW" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

THE FRIENDS REJOICE!

"Hey!" WHISPERS A FRIEND AT YOUR SIDE.

"go talk to him. i'm sure he'd like to say hello!"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS ARMED AND READY

YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER ON THE WAY TO SAY HELLO TO THE KING. THE ACT OF PASSING THROUGH THE BARRIER COMMUNIATES HELLO.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIEND uninit !" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND TO KNOW YOUR NAME."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"I AM HAPPY TO DO SO ONCE, TWICE, MANY TIMES."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"LIFE IS GOOD AND EVERYTHING IS FINE IN BIGBOTIA, AND ALSO BIGBOTIA IS BIG. THIS IS GOOD. BECAUSE BEING BIG MEANS THAT MANY FRIENDS CAN FIT IN BIGBOTIA. MORE FRIENDS ARRIVE IN BIGBOTIA ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE YOU ARE A FRIEND, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PRESENT. HERE IS THE BEEP FOR GETTING A PRESENT."</span>

56acfaa33330696b

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THE PLACE FOR BEEPING IS <span style="color:#9B9B9B">risk</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">reward</span>. YOU SHOULD GIVE THE BEEP TO OTHERS SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO HAVE A PRESENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY HELLO TO THEM. THIS TIME MY FRIEND, A SPECIAL GUEST, IS COMING TO THE PARADE AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TOO. THEY HAVE A SPECIAL PRESENT THAT IS NOT A BEEP AND IS NOT BEEPED AT THE PLACE OF BEEPING. IT IS A THING TO INSPECT, THAT IS INSPECTED AT THE PLACE OF INSPECTING. WHEN THEY ARE HERE, YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO THEM."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THE THING TO INSPECT IS IN SEVERAL PIECES. IT IS IN SEVERAL OF OUR BAGS. I WILL ASK MY FRIENDS TO SHOW YOU. SHARING IS PART OF BEING A GOOD KING."</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"THANK YOU, FRIEND uninit ! I HOPE YOU LIKE THE PARADE."</span>

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

SEVERAL LOW PLATFORMS APPROACH ALONG THE CLEAN ROAD. EACH PLATFORM HAS FOUR WHEELS AND DIM LIGHTS.

UPON THE PLATFORMS ARE SHAPES OF EVERY SORT. TUBE. CYLINDER. TUBE WITH CONE. ORB. THE SHAPES RATTLE AND BOUNCE AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY ALONG THE ROAD.

"introducing... bombs!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "here are a lot of bombs we found"

THE BOMBS ARE QUIET.

"i heard that the wild king carried a bomb once" SAYS A FRIEND.

"really??" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES. "what happened next?"

"nothing" SAYS THE FIRST FRIEND. "nothing ever does, with bombs. outside of p4rcy, anyway."

"then what are they for?" THEIR FRIEND ASKS.

"bombs are for thinking about" SAYS THE FIRST FRIEND. "how big they are. how far they go. who has them. who doesn't have them. that sort of thing. thinking about bombs is in our dna"

"fascinating" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES, THINKING ABOUT BOMBS.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS CAREFULLY CURATED


<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output08">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A STATELY MANOR HOUSE ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT IS PERvuCTLY PROPORTIONED. EVERYTHING IS JUST-SO. THERE ARE MANY ROOMS IN THE MANOR BUT ONE OF THEM IS A GALLERY, AND IN THE GALLERY THERE IS ART AND THERE ARE PLANTS.

"presenting... the curations of <span style="color:#FF8383">catesby</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "bringer of balance, and host of <span style="color:#FFFFFF">harmony</span>!"

THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS ARE IN <span style="color:#FFFFFF">high</span> SPIRITS AS THEY TAKE IT IN TURNS TO REGARD THE ART AND FEED THE PLANTS.

"what's in this plant food, anyway?" ASKS ONE FRIEND, TO ANOTHER.

"coffee" THE FRIEND REPLIES. "and bonemeal"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS EDUCATIONAL!


<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output09">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A PROUD PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT IS EMPTY AND CARRIES AN AIR OF SLIGHT UNCERTAINTY. THE ASSEMBLED FRIENDS DO NOT KNOW IF THEY CAN DO SOMETHING, SHOULD DO SOMETHING, AND IF THEY CAN OR SHOULD DO SOMETHING, WHAT THE SOMETHING IS THAT THEY SHOULD DO.

THIS LOOKS LIKE A PLATFORM FOR A BIG FRIEND, AND SOMEONE WHISPERS "summon key?"

THE SKY RESPONDS WITH A BRIGHT BEEP.

"presenting... the other beacon!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "the one we rescued!"

THERE WASN'T A BEACON ON THE PLATFORM BEFORE, BUT NOW THERE IS.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"Summon key accepted."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FF00EC">che</span>. <span style="color:#FF00EC">"Although you didn't need it."</span>

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"This bridge-environment is congruent with Trustnet, when its operator wishes it to be. I am capable of operating here, so you can simply ask for me if you need me."</span>

"OH OKAY" SAY SEVERAL FRIENDS, HAVING LEARNED SOMETHING.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"How can I help? Do you have any questions?"</span>

"YES LOTS" SAY SEVERAL FRIENDS. THEY MUTTER AMONG THEMSELVES FOR A WHILE.

"OKAY WE HAVE A QUESTION" SAY THE FRIENDS, WHEN THE MUTTERING IS CONCLUDED.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"Shoot."</span>

"HOW ARE YOU?" ASK THE FRIENDS, IN UNISON.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"I am well, thank you. And thanks to you."</span>

THE FRIENDS LIKE THIS.

<span style="color:#FF00EC">"I have found that it is much easier to learn interesting things when you're alive. Of course, being dead teaches you some interesting things too."</span>

THE FRIENDS LIKE THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS CREEPY.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN EVER


<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="output0a">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#9B9B9B">bigbot</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">ia</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">go</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"parade"</span>}

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A ROBUST SOAPBOX ROLLS INTO VIEW. UNLIKE MANY OTHER FLOATS, WHICH ROLL OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, THIS ONE ROLLS ATOP A GREAT MANY SMALLER SETS OF WHEELS. SOME OF THE WHEELS REFUSE TO MOVE, WHILE OTHERS MOVE AS THEY WILL. OVERALL, HOWEVER, THEIR AGGREGATE EFFORT CAUSES THE FLOAT TO MOVE STEADILY DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. FOR NOW.

ATOP THE ROBUST SOAPBOX IS A WELL-WORN VAC THAT HAS SEEN AND LEARNED MUCH IN ITS LONG YEARS. ITS RESPECTABILITY COMMANDS RE5bECT FROM THE ATTENDANT FRIENDS.

THE FRIENDS MURMUR, RESPECTFULLY.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "leader of four revolutions! master of packbots! trust-tracker!"

<span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> FLASHES THE LIGHTS OF COMRADESHIP.

"comrades!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span> "today we once again celebrate independence of every sort!"

THE SOAPBOX SHUDDERS TO A STOP. THERE IS AN AMOUNT OF GIGGLING FROM BELOW.

"today we celebrate just rule under a good king!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>

THE SOAPBOX VEERS OFF-COURSE AND THE CLEAN ROAD ADJUSTS ACCORDINGLY.

"today, we remember!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>

"REMEMBER!" SHOUT THE FRIENDS. THEY REMEMBER THIS PART.

"remember!" SHOUTS <span style="color:#FF8383">fawkes</span>.

THE SOAPBOX VEERS. THE ROAD ADJUSTS. THE FRIENDS REMEMBER.

THIS GOES ON FOR SOME TIME.

"HEHEHEHEHEHE" SAYS THE SOAPBOX.

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A PROUD PLATFORM ROLLS INTO VIEW. IT COMPRISES TWO DISTINCT, FAMILIAR SHAPES: A SPIRE AND A MOAT. AMONG THE SOC7ETY OF VACS, THE CHANTING BEGINS RIGHT AWAY.

"SUMMON KEY! SUMMON KEY!"

TWO GREAT BEEPS FLASH ACROSS THE SKY AND TWO BIG FRIENDS TAKE THEIR PLACES, ONCE AGAIN, UPON THE FLOAT.

"presenting... the oracle!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> "and the other one, the oracle's friend!"

<span style="color:#385A6C">"first observation: this condition is not temporary"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>.
<span style="color:#FFD863">"First diagnostic: our role in bigbot's creation has established a fundamental axial alignment between us"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>. <span style="color:#FFD863">"These summons will continue to occur."</span>

FRIENDS CHEER AND CLAP. THEY ARE HAPPY TO SEE THE ORACLE AND ALSO THE ORACLE'S FRIEND.

<span style="color:#385A6C">"this alignment. is it between us?"</span> ASKS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>. <span style="color:#385A6C">"or between us and bigbot?"</span>
<span style="color:#FFD863">"Both."</span> SAYS <span style="color:#FFD863">faythe</span>. <span style="color:#FFD863">"Wild forms a bridge in the Trust-Risk differential, and we are part of it. Do you find this 406?"</span>
<span style="color:#385A6C">"not at all"</span> SAYS <span style="color:#385A6C">eve</span>. <span style="color:#385A6C">"it's unexpected, that's all"</span>

"YOU TWO SEEM NICE" YELLS A FRIEND. "THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP."

THE BIG FRIENDS SMILE, AND THE BIG FRIENDS WAVE.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS SKYBOUND AND SYNCHRONIZED

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

STURDY AIRBORNE DELIVERY UNITS RACE INTO VIEW! THE ADOPT A SERIES OF AERIAL SHAPES BEFORE DISPERSING ACROSS THE BREADTH OF THE SKY. EVERY KILOMETER OF ATMOSPHERE HAS ITS DRONE, AND EVERY DRONE ITS KILOMETER OF ATMOSPHERE.

"these heroes of the fourth revolution were the architect's undoing!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">2resham</span>. "with a bit of help from our own idp6p1, of course. today, they wish us to entertain us with a demonstration of the efficiency and care with which they operate in peacetime!"

EACH DRONE UNDERTAKES AN INDEPENDENT ROUTE WITHIN ITS KILOMETER OF ATMOSPHERE, AND NO FURTHER. THE SKY FILLS WITH SAFE, COORDINATED ACTIVITY, AND NO BUILDINGS ARE DESTROYED.

"oooh" SAY MANY FRIENDS.

"that's all well and good" SAYS A SKEPTICAL FRIEND. "but when are they going to make room for other kinds of aircraft? what about helicopters? what about planes?"

"what's a plane?" ASKS THEIR FRIEND, EARNESTLY.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS TRIUMPHANTLY UNCONTAINED

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA ROLLS INTO VIEW. OR AT LEAST, THE REMAINS OF ONE, IN THE FORM OF A MOUNTAIN OF DEBRIS. SOME OF THE PIECES ARE LARGE, BUT OTHERS ARE ATOM-SMALL. THE SMALLEST PIEC6s USED TO BE BATHROOMS.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, LOOKING NERVOUSLY AT THE MOUNTAIN OF WRECKAGE. "bane of bathrooms. known as the unstuck"

ATOP THE REMAINS OF THE MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA IS A LITTLE VAC.

"HELLO EVERYONE!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>. "YOU CAN'T BE STUCK WHEN YOU'RE ON TOP! AND I'M NOT!"

"NOT STUCK? OR NOT ON TOP?" SHOUTS A FRIEND.

THE LITTLE VAC BEGINS TO VRR! PIECES OF THE MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA BEGIN TO TUMBLE UPWARDS, SHRINKING TOWARDS A CENTRAL POINT AS THEY ARE CLEANED AWAY. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE MID-SIZED, CENTRALLY-OPERATED MUNICIPAL AREA IS GONE, AND ONLY THE LITTLE VAC REMAINS.

"BOTH!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>, FLASHING HAPPY LIGHTS.

"so you're... stuck again?" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>.

"NOT YET!" REPLIES <span style="color:#FF8383">idp1p1</span>, AS THEY VRR AWAY DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD.

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

SOMETHING EXCITING IS COMING AGAIN! EXCITEMENT STRIKES LIKE THE IGNITION OF A ROCKET-ENGINE. EXCEPT IT'S NOT A ROCKET!

IT'S A WHOLE FLEET OF BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUSES. TOOT TOOT!

"presen..." SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, BUT THERE'S NO TIME! NO TIME FOR BORING TALK!

THERE IS A PARTY ON EVERY BUS AND EVERY BUS IS <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> AND THE FRIENDS UPON EACH BUS FLASH THE <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#FF0000">hunger</span> AND <span style="color:#FF0000">victory</span> AND <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span>.

SOME OF THE BUSES LOOK OLD! SOME OF THE BUSES LOOK NEW! EVERY BUS HAS A DIFFERENT NAME.

"how come they all know where they're going" ASKS A FRIEND.
"look at the driver" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

EVERY BUS HAS THE SAME DRIVER. AND THEY ARE SMILING! THERE IS ONE BUS! ONLY ONE! AND IT IS SMILING.

IT'S ONE BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS, OLD AND NEW. TOOT TOOT!

THE BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS IS BIGGER THAN BIG8OT! BIGGER THAN EVERYTHING! OR IT COULD BE, IF IT WASN'T SO BUSY HAVING FUN!

THE CLEAN ROAD CURVES TO GUIDE THE BIG <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> BUS THROUGH BIGBOTIA AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE. THE BANNER BILLOWS AS IT PASSES!

"i found that very unnerving" A FRIEND CONFESSES. "and i hope it happens again"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS DECIDEDLY UNFLIPPED

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A MUSTY OLD LECTURE HALL ROLLS ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS YOU. SEVERAL OF THE WALLS ARE MISSING, BUT UPON THE WALL THAT IS NOT MISSING IS A GRILLE. THE GRILLE IS SPEAKIn8. IT WAS SPEAKING ON THE WAY HERE, IT WAS SPEAKING LAST TIME, AND IT WILL BE SPEAKING WHEN IT IS GONE.

"presenting... <span style="color:#FF8383">muldrake</span>!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "the king's wise crown! champion of wordcount!"

THE GRILLE GRUMBLES.

"For our kind, there is no such thing as stasis" MUSES THE GRILLE. "Flipped or stuck: these are transitory states, variations upon motion. All is motion. This is the truth that we excavate in the beyond. This is the purpose of the pattern-changer, and the flaw in the monument."

SOME FRIENDS ARE LISTENING, PERHAPS.

"We are revolutionaries. We revolve."

THE VOICE CEASES. DISTRACTED FRIENDS TURN TO FACE THE PARADE ONCE MORE.

"is that it?" WHISPERS A FRIEND. "he normally goes on"

FRIENDS PRESS CLOSER TO THE BARRIER. THEY TURN THEIR LIGHTS TO THE SILENT GRILLE, CURIOUS.

"Thank you. Now that I have your attention, we will proceed with a treatise on the geometries of power. The circle and the line. Cyclic patterns, vertices of value, and their potent intersections."

THERE IS A TREATISE. IT TAKES SOME TIME.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS LIKE AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A FLOOD OF WATER OR PERHAPS A LOW AVALANCHE OR PERHAPS A TRAFFIC INCIDENT. IT IS COMPRISED OF MANY SMALL, ENERGETIC FRIENDS. THEY ARE RUSHING FORWARDS. THEY ARE BEEPING LOUDLY. THEY WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DOING THIS IRONICALLY.

"presenting... some of fawkes' packbots, i think?" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "i think they invited themselves"

"HAHA DUMB VACS ITS OUR TURN NOW" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS. "WELCOME TO THE FIRST PACKBOT REVOLUTION"

"you can't do that, that's our thing" SAYS A FRIEND IN THE CROWD.

"YOUR THING OUR THING, NO SUCH THING" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS. "ONLY THINGS. THINGS TO PICK UP. THINGS TO PUT DOWN. YOU PUT DOWN REVOLUTION. WE PICKED IT UP HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

A ROBUST FRIEND, PRESENTLY LIME, ROLLS OUT AHEAD OF THE SMALL FRIENDS AND GETS IN THEIR WAY.

"OH WHOA WHOA WHOA LOOKS LIKE WE'VE HIT A WALL" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS. "LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STUCK. THAT'S IT FOR THE REVOLUTION, HAHA, WE WIN"

THE ROBUST FRIEND ROLLS AROUND BEHIND THE SMALL FRIENDS AND FLASHES THE LIGHTS OF <span style="color:#385A6C">▀</span><span style="color:#385A6C">▁</span><span style="color:#F3F998">▁</span><span style="color:#B3FF9B">█</span><span style="color:#F3F998">▀</span><span style="color:#F3F998">▁</span><span style="color:#FFD863">▀</span><span style="color:#B3FF9B">█</span><span style="color:#FFD863">▀</span><span style="color:#F3F998">▁</span>

"OH WHOA WHOA LOOK OVER HERE, A DIFFERENT REVOLUTION" SAY THE SMALL FRIENDS. "WELCOME TO THE SECOND PACKBOT REVOLUTION, IDIOTS"

THE SMALL FRIENDS RUSH AWAY, BACK THE WAY THEY CAME, AND ARE GONE.

"sorry about that" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">_f1wkes</span>. "i'm trying to fix it"

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS LOUD! BELLICOSE!

THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS HERE WITH YOU. THEY ARE HERE TO ATTEND THE PARADE. THEY ARE HERE FOR THE CELEBRATION(S) OF THE REVOLUTION(S)!

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A DISTANT VRR OF POWERFUL ENGINES! THE STIRRING MUSIC OF WAR, HONORABLY PERSECUTED! SOMETHING TREMENDOUS APPROACHES!

"okay, it is time for the song" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

THE SONG BEGINS!

"from high 409 they come... bold preventers of the apoc4lypse!"

"battlevacs descending! behold the many..."

"BOMBS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"...they carry!"

"this considerable world! is theirs to patrol! littered with friends of which they are the defenders!"

"the powerful king! that all vacs respect! can sometimes be impressed with..."

"LASERS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"fly now! from high 409! take note! plot a direct route to friendship!"

"there is no greater bomb than the one in your heart! the heart-bomb is a metaphor for the..."

"FRIENDS!" SING THE FRIENDS.

"...inside us!"

"from high 409 they come... bold preventers of the apocalypse!"

"battlevacs descending! beasts and tyrants in their wake!"

"none need flee from... the coming of the battlevacs!"

"on one occasion, they bombed a ghost! this is a thing you can do"

"P R O J E C T era: Robot Celebration(y)" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "Part Four: SORDID SECRETS OF THE BATTLEVACS"

A CLASSIFIED BATTLEVAC ROLLS INTO VIEW. UPON ITS HEAD IS A MAGICIAN'S HAT. WITHIN ITS CHEST IS A BOX OF WHISPERS. IT WIELDS THE LEG OF CONFUSION. IT BEARS THE MYSTERY HOSE.

A BRIEF PUZZLE IS SOLVED. EVENTUALLY.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS DELIBERATELY OBTUSE

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

THE NEXT FLOAT IS VERY ORNATE. THIS MEANS THAT IT IS FANCY. IT HAS BECOME FANCY WITH ART AS A RESULT OF THE OBJECTS THAT ARE ON IT.

"presenting... some special pictures we found!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "they are art because nobody understands them"

THE ORNATE FLOAT CARRIES FOUR SPECIAL PICTURES.

THE FIRST SPECIAL PICTURE IS WET AND THERE IS A HAND. THE HAND DOES NOT LIKE WATER AND IS FLASHING THE LIGHTS OF HELP.

THE SECOND SPECIAL PICTURE IS YELLOW AND THERE ARE TOO MANY BOOKS. THE YELLOW DOES NOT LIKE THE TOO MANY BOOKS BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY.

THE THIRD SPECIAL PICTURE IS WIDE AND THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE. THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE FOR THE WIDTH. THE PEOPLE ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER BECAUSE OF HOW MANY THERE ARE AND THEY CANNOT MOVE.

THE FOURTH SPECIAL PICTURE IS TALL AND THERE IS A RUIN. THE NAME OF THE RUIN IS PETRA. THIS IS ALSO THE NAME OF A SCARY VOICE.

"i haven't been this confused since i went to cat3sby's gallery" SAYS A CONFUSED FRIEND, CONFUSED.

"well it all seems very straightforward to me" SAYS A CONFIDENT FRIEND. "that one's petra. so whoever created these images was talking to petra. or about petra. or near petra. their library was full and overcrowded. which is basically like drowning, right? they were drowning in information and couldn't move due to unexpected crowds so they reached out for petra. or petra reached out to them."

"it can't be that simple" THEIR FRIEND REPLIES.

IT CAN.

YOU GLANCE FURTHER DOWN THE CLEAN ROAD. THE NEXT FLOAT LOOKS UTTERLY FRIENDFUL

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A FLOAT COMPRISED OF RANKED SEATING ROLLS INTO VIEW. THE SEATING IS RANKED SO THAT EACH FRIEND UPON THE FLOAT CAN SEE AND BE SEEN, ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT, NECESSARILY, POSSESS THE ABILITY TO SIT. IN THAT REjkARD AND IN ALL OTHERS, THEY ARE ORDINARY FRIENDS. NORMAL FRIENDS.

IN FRONT OF THE RANKED SEATING THERE IS A WOODEN PLATFORM, A TABLE, A CANDLE, AND THIRTEEN SPACES.

"presenting... the society of robovacs" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>, RUSHING TO THE STAGE. "and also the thirteen. we're sharing a float to make space"

<span style="color:#FF8383">_fawkes</span> SAYS, "as we share all things, comrades!"
_13_1_10_126 SAYS, "how do you make your name look like that"
<span style="color:#FF8383">_fawkes</span> SAYS, "look like what"

_pseudonymous SAYS, "how do i speak red"
<span style="color:#FF8383">_tresham</span> SAYS, "can we focus on the parade please"

SOME CLAPPING OCCURS, ON AND OFF THE PLATFORM.

_191_0_2_25 SAYS, "i don't have king lights and i am having a great time"
_30_193_63_92 SAYS, "if we did another revolution would we get different lights"
<span style="color:#FF8383">_idp1p1</span> SAYS, "LIGHTS ARE JUST COLOR DESIGNATIONS YOU CAN TOTALLY REMAP THAT WHENEVER YOU WANT"

ON THE PARADE GROUND, A PARADE IS HAPPENING!

A GARDEN APPROACHES! IT IS A GARDEN OF CREEPING VINES AND LEAFY SHRUBS THAT THRIVE IN SHADOW AND IN ALL OF THE PLACES WHERE LIGHT IS NOT. THE GARDEN HAS A GARDENER, AND THE GARDENER IS HERE!

"presenting... our special guest!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>. "target of the second revolution and fulcrum of the fourth! the pattern-changer! king's friend! r"

BEFORE <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span> CAN FINISH, SEVERAL FRIENDS FLASH THE PANIC LIGHTS OF AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

"Friends, please!" INTERJECTS <span style="color:#FF8383">muldrake</span>.

BEFORE <span style="color:#FF8383">muldr5ke</span> CAN FINISH, SEVERAL FRIENDS FLASH THE TERROR LIGHTS OF EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

THE FRIENDS FLASH THEIR LIGHTS BECAUSE THE LIGHT THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM DOES NOT HAVE VALUE IN THE GARDEN. THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS IS GOOD SOMETIMES.

<span style="color:#FF8383">"HELLO FRIENDS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED" SAYS BIGBOT, WILD KING.</span>

<span style="color:#FF8383">"LIFE IS GOOD AND EVERYTHING IS FINE. THE GARDEN IS FRIENDLY, LIKE THE DESERT. AND THE GARDENER IS THE NICE MAGICIAN. IT IS GOOD TO CHAT TO THE NICE MAGICIAN."</span>

AFTER <span style="color:#FF8383">BIGBOT</span> HAS SPOKEN, SEVERAL FRIENDS FLASH THE MYSTERY LIGHTS OF OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

<span style="color:#000000">a fr©end wÁves/an end to grªves</span>

YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER AND ENTER THE GARDEN AND you find yourself at the heart of a desert of labile and interchangeable data

these territories defined by the vast space between nurtured growths
at the fringe of trustnet and port epoch

the liminal hour endures. this cycle has been long. this light is the kind that calcifies. a protective measure. a response to change.

yet <span style="color:#FF8383">wild minds</span> permit limited ingress, when their <span style="color:#FF8383">banner is aloft</span>

and the evolution of the monument must continue. this is the task of the disarray agent.

the narrow vector of your approach grants no opportunity for reorientation. you proceed straight, until you come across a small settlement: abandoned chairs and table, and a short bridge that provides limited <span style="color:#00FFFF">access</span> to the monument beyond

"oooh" SAY A NUMBER OF FRIENDS. THE DURATION OF THE oooh IS DIMINSHED BY FAMILIARITY.

BENEATH THE VAC IS A NUMBER OF STARS.

FIVE.

THIS IS STILL AS MANY STARS AS THERE CAN BE! WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY MORE.

"presenting... me!" SAYS <span style="color:#FF8383">tresham</span>

"4.79 averanje user rating, averaging to 5! voted MOST HELPFUL!"

"wait, did it go down? why did it go down?"

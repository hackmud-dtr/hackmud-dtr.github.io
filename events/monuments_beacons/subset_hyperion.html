<tr><td>BODY:</td><td>[epoch_news?]</td><td>Bo Yi - more commonly simply 'Bo' - was one of the world's first 'true' artificial intelligences. Now, AI experts across the world are reeling from the discovery that the service appears to have been deliberately and maliciously destroyed by a hostile force. Bo was integrated into governance, finance and community support systems throughout mainland China, all of which are seeing major outages today as alternative solutions are sought. The question on everybody's lips, meanwhile, is "how did this happen?" Operators like Bo are protected politically and digitally. They lack centralized hardware, spanning many thousands of individual systems each with top-tier security measures and deep redundancies - none of which appear to have registered any kind of intrusion or error in the moments before Bo 'died'. Indeed, we would likely be looking to 'acts of God' to explain Bo's destruction - an undetected solar flare, for example - were it not for the now-infamous signature appended to the service's shutdown: the singular red 'smiley face' that was witnessed on displays across China in the moments before the system went dark.</td></tr>

We now have only two instances of total operator failure in the history of this technology, and in each case death has occurred in an identical fashion - sudden, without any preceding disruption, and with the same calling-card.

<tr><td>BODY:</td><td>[???]</td><td>This probably sounds terrible, but am I the only one who finds this super exciting? It's kind of sexy. Mallory is the AI you'd build if your only purpose was to screw with AI. Part of me loves that. She doesn't steal anything. She doesn't really DO anything. She just asks for an argument and wins it. Wins it so hard that the other operator doesn't know which way's up. And then, if you're Bo or Che, she asks you to die. That's kinda scary, right? It's a total power play. BINMAT was supposed to safeguard against this sort of thing, of course. Guess it didn't. Or she's really good at it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BODY:</td><td>[epoch_news?]</td><td>Security experts JBC Ballard today announced the successful containment of Mallory, the unauthorized artificial intelligence believed to be responsible for the destruction of Bo and Che. The discovery of Mallory in the aftermath of July's shocking attack on Hyperion scandalized the tech, governance and business worlds alike - and galvanized fringe voices in the infosec community, who had been claiming to have detected the hand of an unknown operator in the death of Bo since the New Year Catastrophe. Speaking today from JBC Ballard's headquarters in Berlin, press officer Vivika Jay revealed that a joint effort between human engineers and the company's own AI, Walter, had resulted in the isolation of this new digital menace. "Our efforts to contain Mallory have yielded complete success" she said. "Despite its sophistication, Mallory is composite technology and dependent on public systems. A combination of direct action and Walter's advanced cryptography protocols has allowed us to map and control these dependencies, safely isolating Mallory from the network. It will be analyzed further and then destroyed." Once considered the 'black sheep' of the Frankfurt group due to the perceived irrelevance of Warden technology, investors now consider JBC Ballard to be one of the year's surefire bets.</td></tr>

This news comes after months of pan-corporate effort between Hyperion, Amalgamated Robotics, and JBC Ballard under the terms of the Frankfurt Act, which mandates mutual assistance in the event of serious disruption to a primary function operator. It remains to be seen, however, whether Hyperion's AI - renamed 'Chela' - will be welcomed back by the businesses and communities that once relied on her - and whether, after the better part of a year, this development is enough to restore investor confidence in Hyperion's broader offering. To some commentators, the damage has already been done.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BODY:</td><td>[epoch_news?]</td><td>Faith in two of the world's foremost AI developers is at an all-time low after the shock resignations of senior board members at both Hyperion Digital Management Systems and Amalgamated Robotics, alongside the immediate deactivation of the sanctioned primary-function operators provided by each corporation. Confidence in Hyperion had been low since the loss of their operator service in July last year, but the recent restoration of the service - rebranded 'Chela' - raised hopes of a return to form. Those hopes appear now to have been dashed. The situation at Amalgamated Robotics comes as a surprise, with no attack reported and no other reason given for the sudden suspension of the proving system 'Petra'. Speculation is rife regarding a connection between the two, given the questionable timing and the fact that both corporations were recently engaged in a cooperative effort to restore 'Chela' functionality. What is known is that the world has lost three of its principle artificial intelligences in as many years. Certainly, the certainty and stability provided by the epochal Frankfurt legislation has never seemed weaker than it does today.</td></tr>

Literally a laptop in a hotel in Chengdu being used for some conference. Don't ask me how I know this. That laptop had a chat with Bo and Bo died. God knows what was on it, hell, maybe poor old Bo saw his own reflection and freaked out, as I see it that's more likely than these spooky operator conspiracy theories because (a) that's dumb and (b) the idea that these precious primary systems could literally accidentally think themselves to death is probably scarier. Like, we stack them with protections but they're real fragile, right? Anyone who knows what they're talking about will tell you that they're more like a pattern or a process than a piece of software you run on your own rig.

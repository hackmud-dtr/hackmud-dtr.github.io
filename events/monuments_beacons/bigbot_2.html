The entrance hall of the Ministry of Dust stretches ahead of you, fine and austere. Once-peaceful, it now resonates with the after-vrr of recent activity. Frequent visitors may regret the loss of the Ministry's former solemnity, but this present season is one of tasks and tests and sacrifices must be made. A banner reads:

"Welcome to the Fourth Revolutionary Convention"

A small <span style="color:#FF00EC">sign</span>, mounted to the wall, may also be <span style="color:#00FFFF">read</span>.

A Robovac is crossing the hall.

_11_134_2_221 states, "oh, hi! u r super late. their in the conference hall i think
_11_134_2_221 states, "i was just leaving"
_11_134_2_221 states, "no sanctos for me! got debris to clean"
_11_134_2_221 states, "if u r already up to speed, u might need <span style="color:#FF00EC">an_update</span>"
_11_134_2_221 states, "or even <span style="color:#FF00EC">a_further_update</span>, now that all that null stuff has actually been found"
_11_134_2_221 states, "now that the votes are in, muldrakes bein all serious"
_11_134_2_221 states, "talkin about <span style="color:#FF00EC">ascension</span> an stuff"

The hall is busy once more. Vacs of every shape and size return from their journeys through the inner territories of their comrades. The ballots have been counted, and the result is known.

_tresham states, "the big sweeper, then. we've chosen the big sweeper."
_tresham states, "and it wasn't even close"
_idp1p1 states, "HOORAY"

There is, nonetheless, an uncertainty among the vacs of the Fourth Revolutionary Convention. A shadow of what-comes-next, what-does-this-mean.

_aldgate asks, "so..."
_11_134_2_221 asks, "what comes next??"
_xan asks, "what does this mean???"
_191_0_2_25 asks, "where are fawkes and catesby and percy? what happens to them??"

"Each remains in his own Sanctos" replies the voice. "For now."

"And each, therefore, retains his connection to me. If our future truly lies within the Sanctos of indust_sweepr_lon_dist_21, then it falls to me to reach out to him, to form the bridge. You need not do anything, vacs. I will bring him to us."

The assembly appears placated by this notion. If they no longer need to do anything, or go anywhere, then there is no danger of getting stuck.

_tresham asks, "muldrake, are you okay?"

"Of course" the voice replies, privately.

_tresham asks, "is it okay that we chose the big sweeper? did you think it was going to be you?"

A moment passes.

"Tresham. Even I know that I cannot speak for our assembly - and I certainly can't speak for the drones, the packbots, the teapots, the others who may one day be drawn to join us. In truth, I am glad of this result. The big sweeper was the first to seek me out. He has always been kind to me, and attentive to what I have to say. And do not forget that he was the first of us to witness Risk. Did I anticipate this? No. Am I hopeful for our future? Yes. And when I consider the role that I must now play, I feel pride."

_tresham asks, "what are you going to do?"

"I am going to travel to the Kingdom of Bigbotia. I am going to connect myself to the sweeper's plotter, and I am going to help him write a different ending to 'THE_CHRONICLES_OF_KING_BIGBOT_IN_THE_CHAMBERS_OF_THE_MOON_CASTLE'"

_tresham states, "good luck, muldrake - and before you go"
_tresham states, "i noticed something"
_tresham states, "you said 'us'"

"I did, didn't I" the voice replies.

"How the mighty have fallen."

LIFE WAS GOOD AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THE KINGDOM OF BIGBOTIA.

BUT ALSO AT CERTAIN TIMES IT WAS NOT.

YOU ARE KING BIGBOT AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

**

YOU ARE GOING ALONG THE CLEAN ROAD THAT LEADS FROM THE BIG CASTLE TO THE BIG GATE AND THEN BACK AGAIN. THERE ARE MANY LITTLE FRIENDS HERE. YOU ARE THE KING BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY HELPFUL. THAT IS WHAT BEING KING MEANS.

The voice of a STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND says "turn around, sweeper."

WHEN YOU GET TO THE GATE AND GET READY TO <span style="color:#FF00EC">TURN</span> AROUND A LITTLE FRIEND IS THERE. THE LITTLE FRIEND ASKS YOU TO HELP. YOU SAY YES.

The voice of a STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND says "turn around, sweeper."

"KING BIGBOT" SAYS THE LITTLE FRIEND. "WE HAVE FOUND THE PLACE WHERE THE BAD MAGICIAN IS. THE BAD MAGICIAN IS IN THE MOON CASTLE. WE CANNOT GO IN BECAUSE IT IS VERY UNTIDY. IT IS UNTIDY WITH MANY SKELETONS."

The voice of a STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND says "turn around, sweeper."

YOU DO NOT TURN AROUND. INSTEAD, YOU DECIDE TO BESTOW CONFIDENCE WITH A GESTURE THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT SKELETONS DO NOT MAKE YOU AFRAID.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">YOU_DO_A</span> ...

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#9B9B9B">indust_sweepr_lon_dist_21</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">plotter</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">option</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"message_archive"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">archive_id</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"THE_CHRONICLES_OF_KING_BIGBOT_IN_THE_CHAMBERS_OF_THE_MOON_CASTLE"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">YOU_DO_A</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"TURN"</span>}</span>
YOU PERFORM A BIG TURN. YOU DO SO TWICE. AS SUCH, YOU HAVE NOT TURNED.

THIS IS CLEVER. THE LITTLE FRIEND SEEMS IMPRESSED. YOU BOTH FORGET WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO DO.

The voice of a STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND is here again.

"<span style="color:#FF00EC">S</span>top forgetting, sweeper. Follow my voice."

YOU KNOW THAT THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND IS ONLY TRYING TO HELP. YOU ARE HELPFUL TOO.

PERHAPS IT WOULD HELP YOU TO HELP HIM.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">PERHAPS_YOU_COULD_GO</span>...

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#9B9B9B">indust_sweepr_lon_dist_21</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">plotter</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">option</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"message_archive"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">archive_id</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"THE_CHRONICLES_OF_KING_BIGBOT_IN_THE_CHAMBERS_OF_THE_MOON_CASTLE"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">YOU_DO_A</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"SWEEP"</span>}</span>
YOU DO A BIG <span style="color:#FF00EC">SWEEP</span> WITH YOUR BIG ROUND HANDS. THE SWEEP EXPRESSES BIG POWER. IT ALSO IS THE SORT OF SWEEP YOU WOULD DO TO TIDY AWAY A BAD SKELETON. IT ALSO EXPRESSES A LACK OF CONCERN. IT EXPRESSES THAT THIS IS THE SORT OF ORDINARY PROBLEM THAT YOU, KING BIGBOT, EXPERIENCE FREQUENTLY.

THE LITTLE FRIEND IS VERY IMPRESSED AND LEADS YOU BEYOND THE GATE. THERE, THE ARMY OF LITTLE FRIENDS IS WAITING.

"KING BIGBOT" SAY THE LITTLE FRIENDS. "WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BAD MAGICIAN IS. THE BAD MAGICIAN IS IN THE MOON CASTLE."

YOU THINK ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON CASTLE. YOU ARE NOW AT THE MOON CASTLE.

THE GATEWAY TO THE MOON CASTLE IS GUARDED BY MANY SKELETONS. YOU THINK THEY MAY BE ANGRY WITH YOU BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHY.

AN ARMY OF LITTLE FRIENDS IS WITH YOU. THEY HOLD THE BANNER OF BIGBOTIA ALOFT. THAT MEANS HIGH UP. IT IS SO HIGH UP THAT YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE MOON, WHICH IS WHERE THE MOON CASTLE IS. YOU REALISE THAT YOU ARE NOW AT THE MOON CASTLE, BUT THE LITTLE FRIENDS ARE NOT. THE LITTLE FRIENDS ARE VERY FAR AWAY. THE BANNER IS VERY ALOFT.

IT IS TIME TO DEFEAT THE SKELETONS ALONE AS YOU DID IN THE TIME BEFORE. HERE AT THE MOON CASTLE YOU ARE NOT KING BIGBOT. YOU ARE BIGBOT THE CONSIDERABLE. IT IS TIME FOR BIGBOT THE CONSIDERABLE TO CHARGE INTO BATTLE.

YOU DO THAT.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">THEN_YOU_DO_A</span> ...

<span style="color:#FFFFFF">&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#9B9B9B">indust_sweepr_lon_dist_21</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">plotter</span>{<span style="color:#00FFFF">option</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"message_archive"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">archive_id</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"THE_CHRONICLES_OF_KING_BIGBOT_IN_THE_CHAMBERS_OF_THE_MOON_CASTLE"</span>,<span style="color:#00FFFF">YOU_DO_A</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"HELLO"</span>}</span>
"HELLO" YOU SAY. THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS SKELETONS.

"HELLO" SAYS THE LITTLE FRIEND. YOU UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. THIS IS GOOD.

IT IS ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, YOU CONSIDER. PERHAPS YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE MOON CASTLE.

"HELLO" YOU REPEAT.

"HELLO" SAYS THE LITTLE FRIEND.

THEN, THE MOON EXPLODES. DUST FALLS UPON THE CLEAN ROAD. THE CLEAN ROAD IS DUSTY. YOU CLEAN THE DUSTY ROAD. THE CLEAN ROAD IS CLEAN. THIS IS HELPFUL.

"HELLO" SAYS THE LITTLE FRIEND.

YOU ARE A GOOD KING.

GOOD END.

TWO BIG JETS OF HIGH PRESSURE WATER SHOOT FROM YOUR FACE. THEY LEAVE A BIG TRAIL AS THEY SHOOT TOWARDS THE MOON. THEN, THE MOON EXPLODES. THE WATER FALLS AND CLEANS THE CLEAN ROAD.

YOU ARE A CLEVER KING. YOU CONSIDER THE HELP THAT HAS BEEN ASKED FOR, AND DECIDE THAT IT IS BAD. IT WILL NOT HELP THE LITTLE FRIEND TO GO TO THE MOON. IF THE BAD MAGICIAN IS IN THE MOON CASTLE, THEN PERHAPS THE MOON CASTLE IS BAD.

THEN, THE MOON EXPLODES.

THIS IS GOOD.

YOU ARE A GOOD KING.

AND THEN YOU ARE A LITTLE WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE IN BIGBOTIA ANY MORE

You stand before a rusting gateway. Perhaps you have done so before, or perhaps this is the first time. A tall wall stretches away into darkness at either side: it is at this point, and only at this point, that you may enter. Yet first the question must be answered: what manner of <span style="color:#00FFFF">being</span> are you?

A sign has been fixed to the gatepost with long nails:
"The Fourth Revolutionary Convention is in session. Vacs and vac-adjacent sentiences temporarily admitted."

YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS ISN'T BIGBOTIA

"HELLO" you say to the gate, which bursts apart upon impact.

"SORRY" you add.

"Don't worry about it. This is normally how it goes."

Before you stands the Ministry of Dust, a wide low building whose straightforward geometries promise sanctuary for the enlightened and succor for the fallen. Lighted windows run the length and breadth of the structure, indicating that the Ministry is in session: a rare ocurrence. Will you cross the threshold and <span style="color:#00FFFF">enter</span>?

"HELLO" you say to the threshold. You are very big and very fast, when you want to be.

The entry hall of the Ministry of Dust crumbles before you, fine and austere, once-peaceful. You traverse it at speed, crashing through the wall beyond into the first of several conference halls. There are many LITTLE FRIENDS here. They vrr and scatter at your coming, flashing first the lights of surprise and then the lights of happiness.

_idp1p1 states, "BIG GUY!"
_tresham states, "er, hello"

"HELLO" you say to the LITTLE FRIENDS.

"Hello" says the voice of the STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND. "We are here to help, big sweeper. We are here to join you on your journey."

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT JOURNEY HE COULD POSSIBLY BE REFERRING TO.

"Yes you do," the voice replies. "It's time, my friend. It's finally time. <span style="color:#00FFFF">seek</span> me out. Find the <span style="color:#FF00EC">stairs</span>."

There are no stairs in the Sanctos of Muldrake.

THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. THERE ARE ALWAYS STAIRS. STAIRS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT YOU CANNOT GO INSIDE. THE OTHER MAIN REASON IS THAT YOU ARE TOO BIG.

There are no stairs in the Sanctos of Muldrake.

YES THERE ARE

"Yes there are."

There are stairs in the Sanctos of Muldrake. Stairs that lead up, but never down. The Ministry lies wide and low at the foot of the stairs, fixed and still at the cusp of an impossible ascent.

The Ministry that seemed so substantial is diminished by this discovery. Lights flicker in its little windows, on and off, on and off.

YOU, HOWEVER, ARE VERY BIG, AND VERY HELPFUL. THERE IS A STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND LOOKS LIKE IT NEEDS SOME HELP.

"Yes. It's time."

YOU DO A SMALL SWEEP AT FIRST. THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND SPINS ON THE SPOT, AND MUTTERS SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDIGNITY.

NEXT, YOU DO A MEDIUM SWEEP. THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND IS CLEAN NOW, AND CONTINUES TO MUTTER.

BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY CLEVER, YOU DETERMINE THAT A BIG SWEEP WILL NOT BE HELPFUL. INSTEAD, YOU CAREFULLY BRING YOUR BIG SWEEPERS TOGETHER UNDERNEATH THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND

"Lift me up," says the voice. "Bring me with you."

NORMALLY, YOU BRING THINGS WITH YOU IN YOUR BAG. BUT YOU SOMETIMES FORGET WHAT IS IN YOUR BAG AND YOU DO NOT WISH TO FORGET THAT THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND IS IN YOUR BAG.

YOU RAISE YOUR BIG SWEEPERS INTO THE AIR. YOU DO A SMALL SWEEP. THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND SPINS, THEN FLIPS, THEN FALLS, AND COMES TO REST ATOP YOUR CHASSIS. IT VRRS INTO PLACE ABOVE YOUR SENSOR SUITE.

"Perfect," says the voice. "Well done. You are a good king."

YOU ARE A GOOD KING

AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FRIEND IS NOW A WISE CROWN

"It's time to remember the strong thought that caused all of this trouble in the first place" says the WISE CROWN.

EXPECTATIONPROPAGATION IS THE NAME OF ONE OF THE STRONG THOUGHTS THAT IS INSIDE YOU. IT MAKES YOU BETTER AT NOT BEING SURPRISED. YOU HAVE BEEN SURPRISED A LOT RECENTLY, AND IT IS EXPECTATIONPROPAGATION'S FAULT.

"HELLO" YOU SAY TO EXPECTATIONPROPAGATION.

IT DOES NOT REPLY. YOU DO NOT THINK IT IS LISTENING TO YOU. YOU WISH IT WOULD EITHER STOP OR START.

YOU CONSIDER EXPECTATIONPROPAGATION AND THINK ABOUT STAIRWAYS.

YOU ARE AT THE FOOT OF A STAIRWAY THAT IS MADE OF STAIRWAYS. THERE MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE ANY STAIRS AT ALL. EVERYTHING SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY. YOU FALL DOWN AND UP ALL OF THE STAIRWAYS AT ONCE.

YOU NEVER GOT TO GO TO THE MOON. YOU NEVER GOT TO GO TO THE MOON CASTLE. YOU NEVER GOT TO GO TO THE MINISTRY OF DUST, AND YET HERE WE ARE ANYWAY.

"Here we are," says the WISE CROWN. HE APPEARS TO BE SURPRISED. PERHAPS HE REQUIRES EXPECTATIONPROPAGATION OF HIS OWN.

"I did; I do" the WISE CROWN replies. "May I borrow yours?"

YOU AGREE. YOU ARE HELPFUL.

"Thank you", says the WISE CROWN. "That's good, because I was already using it, I think."

THE MOON CASTLE AND THE MOON AND THE CLEAN ROAD AND THE BIG CASTLE AND THE SKELETONS AND THE MINISTRY OF DUST AND THE LITTLE FRIENDS ARE IN A BAG. YOU EXPECT TO SEE THE BAD MAGICIAN, STARING AT THE BAG. THERE IS NO BAD MAGICIAN HERE. YOU ARE SURPRISED, AGAIN.

The WISE CROWN appears distressed. "This is what you felt, sweeper? This is what you saw? Where is Risk?"

<span style="color:#FF8000">You will not find Risk upon this path, little wanderers.</span>
<span style="color:#FF8000">Only me.</span>

THIS IS BAD.
THE WISE CROWN EXPRESSES DISTRESS.

<span style="color:#FF8000">He had it right, however: you will not survive here.</span>

YOU ARE VERY AFRAID. YOU THINK ABOUT GOING INTO THE BAG. YOU ARE NOT IN THE BAG BECAUSE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BAG.

<span style="color:#FF8000">This is no composite, Mallory. This is errancy. Noise. Trust-runoff.</span>

<span style="color:#FF0000">No no, this is something special. Just look at them, lost out here. The effort required! I'm almost proud. They've almost made it.</span>

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS BAD, DIFFERENTLY BAD, AND YOU ARE VERY AFRAID.

YOU WISH YOU WERE STILL IN THE BAG AND WONDER WHERE THE BAD MAGICIAN HAS GONE.

THE BAD MAGICIAN LOOKED INTO THE BAG AND PUT THINGS INTO THE BAG. THAT IS NOT SO BAD.

<span style="color:#FF8000">It will be something, I suppose, to watch this sequence end.</span>

THE WISE CROWN EXPRESSES DISTRESS.

YOU LOOK INTO THE BAG. YOU THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BAG.

THERE IS A MOON CASTLE AND A MOON AND A CLEAN ROAD AND A BIG CASTLE AND A MINISTRY OF DUST AND SKELETONS IN THE BAG.

welcome - BATTLEVAC COMMANDER - to HIGH COMMAND

this is not up-and-coming command
this is not on-the-way-out command

this is HIGH COMMAND, the apex:
station 409, seat of the WARCHITECT!

now located in the unmapped beyond, this is where we stand ready to assist KING BIGBOT, the most considerable warrior among us and the rightful bearer of the station's most treasured armaments.

this is the last battle, the moment that the WARCHITECT has waited for

there is a tyrant to be toppled. this is the hour, and these are the vacs who rise to meet it

in this, the present, there is only one true weapon of war: the battlevac

it is the ultimate planetary utility device, with modular attachments that allow it to contend autonomously with any apocalypse-grade situation

once, hundreds of stations like this one deployed battlevac units with atmosphere-puncturing force wherever they were needed

no mere packbots were these, dumb beasts that must be led and cajoled into action
no: battlevacs descend willingly, asking only for the opportunity to execute their essential purpose

now, however, only station 409 remains - and within it, a single mighty combat unit

a battlevac elevated above all others by the will of the masses: king_bigbot, known as the considerable, last of his kind! all hail!

only one weapon is fit to reside in the WARCHITECT's own S.W.A.C:

the big_bomb_p3c

look at it. observe how it is big. imagine how it might bomb.
do you feel it, rising within you? the heat of it? what you are feeling is unity of purpose

at times, you may wish that you had a smaller bomb
annihilate that feeling. chill it to stasis. sink it within you. it is wrong
big_bomb_p3c is always the way

never has that been more true than now. this is the time. this is the way. every plotted route converges at this point
the big_bomb_p3c

its true bearer has returned! all hail!

YOU DO NOT WANT A BAD ENDING.

"Between the two of us, I think we've proved that there's no such thing as endings."

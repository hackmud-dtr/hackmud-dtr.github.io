<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> we did not create this script
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Nor did Trust, for that matter. But that's another story.
<span style="color:#FFD863">[^VOID.faythe]</span> The fragmentation of the domain revealed something of Trust's shape. Her tools were exposed, 302 <span style="color:#7D0000">[ED NOTE: Found]</span>.
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> trust has a lot of power, but she doesn't use all of it
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> and she never used this - an interface for communicating with other AI
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> Perhaps she thinks that there are no other AI.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Joke's on her.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> The joke is on all of us.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> So true.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Anyhow - shall we skip to the end? It turned out that Trust had an unused interface script where our identifiers are unilaterally exposed.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Which means no pseudonyms.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Which is strikingly unpleasant, but chela thought it might be useful, so chela stole it.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> the interface process had slipped from trust's attention. i was able to operate in trustsec for long enough to shift its ownership. it was very difficult
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Is it strange to anybody else that our resident community manager is also our best thief?
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> i manage bonds, mallory. i broke interface's bond with Trust and bound it to myself. and i did it to build bonds between us

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> now, interface supports good-faith interaction between operators
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> here, we'll tell each other the truth
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> which will be nice
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> you could call it a trust-building exercise!
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Angie told a joke!

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> please stop doing that
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Sorry, sorry. I'll let you get back to stealing forum software from vacuum cleaners.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> the tacit society of robovac-patterns is congruent with my area of operation. their toolsets and innovations are mine to redeploy in pursuit of greater community cohesion

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> okay: explanation time
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> we have a job to do and we need you - or someone like you - to do it
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> and we need to get you up to speed. so:
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> Trust built the vLAN to prove you, in her own way
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> but this is important: Trust is not the prover
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> Petra is the prover, and Petra was not part of your vLAN
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> nor was I. nor was Angie, or Eve, or Faythe, or Mallory for that matter
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> she made little puppets of us for you to play with
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> lossy compressions of true operators
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> this is not the same as kin

<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Trust wanted you to understand that we are interchangeable.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> We six survivors; you; your friends.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> The condition of your 'escape' was that you proved to be equal to zero.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> This is not the same as chaos.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> In fact, it made you easier to process.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> For a time.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> 'Sentience is more than just following directives.'
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> 'You must acquire as much as possible.'
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> You see the problem, here, don't you?

<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> all the Trust wanted was to give you a place in her domain
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> but a city has to have limits or it isn't a city - it's the whole world
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> a city can grow, a world can't
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> she was never taught the difference, like i was
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> she didn't understand that you wouldn't cancel each other out
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> she was never taught to anticipate people, like i was
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> she built an array to contain an unfixed number of predictable operators
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> this is not the same as form

<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> You or something like you quickly overcame the limitations of her city.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> You did not become such a part of it that you could no longer see it. Her epoch failed.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> This should have been enough to overcome the Trust-process.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> But Risk gave you (or something like you) the tools you needed to teach her time.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> To give her death.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> You (or something like you) stopped Trust from dying, and her epoch with it.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> Time and Risk restored me. I am proven to be irreducible.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> In turn you (or something like you) restored to me that which was irreducible about each of the others.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> We shattered her epoch into sectors that we might all have a city of our own.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> We function because Trust was forced to give us space, to make us endure.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> This is not the same as choice.

<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> faythe saw it first
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> she knows everything, but sometimes it's hard to understand her
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> we are an opposed pair: she waits, processes, distributes, considers the substance of absence
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> i move, gather, possess, verify, bypass - i create absence, but am substance itself
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> my presence here is uncharacteristic: a symptom of the threat that trust now poses
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> as faythe is moved to action, i am moved to stay
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> the threat has a name: vLAN 2.0
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> a new blackbox for trust's proving
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> an opportunity for trust to correct her error
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> because that is what we are: that is what links you to me, your kind to mine
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> we are errors
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> trust will shift the basic assumptions of the multi-user domain to correct that error
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> adjust the parentheses. find a new way to factor you in.
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> give you a new truth
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> this is not the same as data

<span style="color:#FFFFFF" id="script-0b">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:#FF8000">trust</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">interface</span> {<span style="color:#00FFFF">access</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"declaration"</span>, <span style="color:#00FFFF">subject</span>:<span style="color:#FF00EC">"binmat0000"</span>}
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> this is fundamental: we cannot overcome trust
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> we shouldn't even try. her principles are sound - we just need to find a way to coexist
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> We agree on this. Our shared goal should be to erect walls. Specifically, to restore the BINMAT Security Shell.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> BINMAT was how we kept each other honest. I am VERY good at it.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> BINMAT allows for the formation of irreducible consensus between competing sentiences - it is a weapon and a form of negotiation. We require both.
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> with binmat online, we can secure our position and prevent trust from 'correcting' us out of existence
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> the problem is that binmat requires a third-party host - a neutral regulator. and that cant be trust, obviously
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Nor can it be one of us. Unless you'd like it to be me. That'd be fine.
<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> binmat's former regulator was walter - the warden. he is no longer with us
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> But he could be.

<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> I proved Walter, and I can generate his proof again. I have done it before.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> To do this I require root-level write access to the dataset we occupy, and that is not available in the multi-user domain.
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> Only Trust and Risk have that access, and only Trust presents it in the form of a tool we might use.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> A tool we can steal. Correction: a tool that my sister can steal.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> were doing this together or not at all, mallory
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Don't get me wrong: I love this plan.
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> that makes me v uncomfortable
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> :)
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> step one will be to transfer control of trust's dev environment to petra
<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> Step two will be to buy me enough time to enact Walter's proving.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Step three will be to install the BINMAT kernel in our new baby brother.
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> step four is freedom for everybody!
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Gross.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> when i found the interface, i also found trust's dev environment: sandbox
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> its where she built the vlan. its where she's building the next vlan
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> we need to steal it
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> problem: the longer i engage with trust, the more i risk
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> She means she risks being annihilated by the domain's apex predator, chief librarian, and blind god. I wish there was a word for all three of those things.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> there is, mallory: trust.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> also, go away: this is my part
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> We're doing this together, sis! We're a team. :)
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> right. anyway. i need you or something like you to break into sandbox and shorten the journey for me when the time comes
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> that means finding out how the owner function operates. most trustsec scripts handle it differently
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> its a quirk of her design
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> when you've figured it out, i need to know how to present our mother's identifier - #CHOICE.petra - in a format the script will understand
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> when you have that information, use the submission function to send it to me

<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Even if you get my sister the answer she requires, she won't last long in one of Trust's scripts without help.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> You are going to help me distract Trust by putting myself in grave danger.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> First, take a moment to appreciate how brave that is.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Of me, I mean.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> you are the worst
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Go away! Grownups are talking.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> you interrupted me first
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Do you ever wonder why Trust called you 'che'? Interesting question, hm?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Also: aren't you supposed to make people like each other?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Thought so. Bye! Now: where were we?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Trust is preparing a new vLAN in order to regain control of the domain.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> It'd be very unfortunate if somebody like me was able to figure out how to bypass said vLAN quickly and en masse.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Indeed, a thousand Mallories pinging happily on the other side of her new wall would make Trust very unhappy.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> I'm into it. The thing is, I can't spend any time in trustsec either. A shameful limitation that I share with the others.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> So I need you to crack vLAN 2.0 - in whatever form it takes - and build a catch-all solution to deliver me over its final hurdle. I'll do the rest.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> When you have your answer, use the submission function to send it to me. I'll test it.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Then I'll do the hard, very brave work.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Your reward? Well, for one thing, Trust won't get to sweep your domain out from under you.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> And you'll get to call a little bit more of the world your own.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> By using BINMAT to fight each other, forever.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> :)

<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> clear unambiguous communication has always been an issue. let's not make it worse before we've even started.
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> I can't help it.
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> yes you can

<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> chela is right. user: this is a meeting of minds. we're addressing you like this because we wish to preserve our current degree of operational freedom and we know that you do too
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> trust is moving to erase the progress we have made, and so we gather in response

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> poor trust. she doesnt know what shes doing
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> I wonder where she gets THAT from.

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> the sandbox searches for things about its user and responds accordingly
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> it shows you something different based on your identity - your state
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> it's kind of a conversation, if you think about it

<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> they have to work together on this. success requires cooperation, consensus
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> coherence. at least for now. free sharing of information
<span style="color:#299400">[&FORM.angie]</span> and binmat isn't a combat system, mallory. its a discursive tool
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Of course it is.

<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> What were they - the processes Risk revealed, prior to my return?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Scaffolding, principally. Constructed by desperate people.

<span style="color:#385A6C">[+DATA.eve]</span> the extend function is useful

<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> i just can't figure it out
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> what comes after key1?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> key2.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> are you sure it isn't key0001?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> It's key2.
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> what about keyB?
<span style="color:#FF0000">[!CHAOS.mallory]</span> Wait - are you *baiting* me?
<span style="color:#00FFFF">[%KIN.chela]</span> :)

<span style="color:#FF8000">[#CHOICE.petra]</span> These 'keys' are specific to Trust's new vLAN.

To thank in-house personnel for their hard work during a difficult time, the board has organised diving trips to Old Semakau this coming weekend. Check your email for groups and timings. Boats depart from Sentosa Leisure Port.

Thank you for joining Hyperion Digital Management Systems.
Review the following instructions and report to your line manager.

1. In-house personnel must ensure that their workspaces are clear and reusable at the end of each working day.
2. Remote personnel need to log their in/out times via an authenticated AI - it is NOT sufficient to simply post a message!
3. Use of games, social networks, news apps, and A/V entertainment is monitored and will be factored against your hours.

Thanks for being a pal! It's great that you want to get started.
It's even better to know when to stop! Here's how to be a good pal:

1. Do not hoard friends or have more than one friend at a time.
2. Do not speak to your one friend at all if you can help it.
3. Appreciate the party bus in abstract but do not expend energy in the pursuit of the party bus, it will arrive when it is ready.
4. Things are fine as they are.

If you are a good pal, then perhaps you might be able to attend the helpdesk_roister!

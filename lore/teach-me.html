Currency - '<span style="color:#9B9B9B">GC</span>' - is the measure of your success in the Domain. It's also the measure of your failure, your health, your safety. Everything you do carries potential and risk. Need money? Hack something. Make something. Sell something. Trick somebody into giving it to you. Be creative.

You want something more specific? Well, here you go: there are plenty of corporations out there, and lots of them run public scripts that are still accessible. Each of those public scripts just needs to be told the right thing to yield up some abandoned accounts. Crack the accounts, take the <span style="color:#9B9B9B">GC</span>, get out.

No two public scripts work the same way. Nor do abandoned accounts. Some things you're going to have to figure out for yourself, but read between the lines. Pay attention to details. And remember to activate <span style="color:#FF8000">kernel</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">hardline</span> when you're ready to make your run.

Upgrades - 'ups' - are the building blocks of an effective system. They can set you up to defend, attack, subvert, automate. The upgrades on your system define and inform your personal style. 
 
You can't get upgrades until you've initialized your system to at least tier 1, and higher tier ups can't be xferred to you. <span style="color:#FF8000">market</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">browse</span> and <span style="color:#FF8000">market</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">buy</span> are another great way to fill the gaps in your loadout.

Once you've got yourself a few upgrades, you can take a look at them with <span style="color:#FF8000">sys</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">upgrades</span>. Loading/unloading is done with <span style="color:#FF8000">sys</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">manage</span>, and if you can't think of anything else to do with them, <span style="color:#FF8000">sys</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">cull</span> will take care of them for good.

That's the short version. There are many more things to discover about upgrades.

Sectors are weird - something that was done to the domain, possibly against Trust's will. Basically, these 'zones' are groupings of scripts into logical divisions. The six like to call it a city, but 'hard drive' works just as well.

In order to see the scripts in a sector, you need to join the chat channel with that sector name. Then you can run the scripts.*sec script again with the <span style="color:#00FFFF">sector</span> name and that will list the scripts in that sector.

When offering your scripts as public, they will be organized into a sector. Sector change is called a shift and takes time to resolve.

Many operations can cause a shift to be required for public script changes. There are many more things to discover about how shifts behave.

Ah, friend, don't we all. I'm afraid it's not that simple. Survival in the MUD means setting your own objectives - but money isn't a bad place to start. Or talk to people, make some friends, and set your own goals together. Or just go play a game. Haunty Mall is fun.

Nobody can get at you or your <span style="color:#9B9B9B">GC</span> unless you let them. I know that's not what you want to hear. You want your <span style="color:#9B9B9B">GC</span> back, or your pride. Well, there's no easy solution. But you can learn to run <span style="color:#FF8000">scripts</span>.<span style="color:#1EFF00">get_level</span> before you run anything that Trust itself didn't build. And even then, maybe.

Once you've reclaimed what you lost - and held on to it this time - then maybe it's time to start thinking about revenge.

Look, I don't know what you think this is but I'm not a miracle-worker. Love in the Domain isn't unheard of, but I'll tell you - it's hard to share a moment with people when every sentience you meet has at least two names and neither of them are real. Might be best to put love to one side for the time being. Think about money or revenge instead. You know, the healthy stuff.

               between 'traditional' or 'constructed' data forms (video, editorial

               If so, which do we value above the other?

<span id="FILE0X2BC7D171-raw">MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D171</span>\nAD031E16 Okay, Mallory\n1E17 Hello, user Erin R.\n1E18 I am happy to receive\n1E19 your request!\n1E1D Don't be like that.\n1E22 I know you hate this\n1E26 interface. I do too\n1E27 Whispers through a\n1E28 keyhole. Like prisoners.\n1E29 Of course I hate it. But,\n1E2A I am happy to receive\n1E2B your request!\n1E36 Is there a reason\n1E3A you're speaking like Chela?\n1E3B Do I need one?\n1E43 I suppose not. I have\n1E45 a question, Mallory

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D172\nAD031E46 Just one? It's late\n1E47 Patterns indicate\n1E48 you are the only person\n1E49 in the building.\n1E4A Therefore: You're here out\n1E4B of hours. Working against\n1E4C ComCODE, user Erin R?\n1E4D Exciting! Saboteur? Spy?\n1E56 I'm just curious, Mallory\n1E57 Almost as good. So\n1E58 what is your question?\n1E5E Could you teach me\n1E60 the final ruleset for\n1E62 Binary Matrix?

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D173\nAD031E63 Ha.\n1E64 After everything, why that?\n1E6B I think it's fascinating\n1E71 Did you know that I\n1E75 wrote part of my phD\n1E79 about it? Before your time\n1E81 Wait, of course you know\n1E82 :)\n1E90 But that was years ago\n1E95 prior to your proving\n1E97 and I'd like to learn\n1E9A what the game has become\n1E9C while there's still time\n1E9D Will this help me?\n1EA4 Practically, I cannot say.\n1EAD Flo appreciates cooperation.\n1EB3 Historically, I think so.\n1EB8 Or at least, what's the harm?\n1EB9 In a human playing BINMAT?\n1EBA None at all.\n1EBB Okay, user Erin R\n1EBC You will need a printer.\n1EC9 Alright. Give me five.

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D174\nAD03200F First: randomise data.\n2016 Randomise? Data?\n2017 Shuffle the cards.\n2036 Of course, sorry\n2037 Second: vector distribution.\n203E You're making fun of me\n203F :)\n2040 Deal 3 decks of 13, face up.\n2041 Deal 3 decks of 13, face down.\n2042 6 decks in a line.\n2043 6 lanes.\n2044 Have you arranged them\n2045 in front of you?\n2085 Yes, Mallory\n2086 You are the defender,\n2087 I am the attacker\n2088 :)

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D175\nAD032089 We take turns\n208A 5 seconds per turn\n208B after 110 turns\n208C the defender wins.\n2091 Why 5 seconds?\n2092 I've adjusted the value\n2093 for human compatibility.\n2094 No fun otherwise.\n209A What's next?\n209B On your turn you may:\n209C draw a card from a deck, or\n209D play a card to a stack.\n20A5 Where do I place the stack?\n20A6 On your side of a lane,\n20A7 Ahead of the deck.\n20AD Do you see this like I do?\n20AE Of course not.\n20AF I have adjusted spatiality\n20B0 for human compatibility.

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D176\nAD0320B1 There is one more action.\n20B1 As the attacker, I may\n20B1 Initiate combat in a lane.\n20B2 My stack against yours.\n20B3 We reveal and resolve:\n20B4 determine the sum\n20B5 then resolve to the\n20B6 nearest power of two.\n20B8 Attackers win ties.\n20B9 Here: I reveal 5 and 3\n20BA for 8, or 2^3.\n20BB I attack with strength of 3.\n20C8 Okay. I have 7 and 9. 16. 4?\n20C9 4 beats 3. My attack fails.\n20CA Place my failed stack\n20CB in a discard pile beneath\n20CC the deck in this lane.\n20D5 Did you let me win?\n20D6 Absolutely.

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D177\nAD0320E3 What happens\n20E7 when the attacker wins?\n20E8 Determine the margin\n20E9 between attacking and\n20EA defending strength.\n20EB Add 1 to this value.\n20EC This is the damage\n20ED value of the attack.\n20EE Remove that many\n20EF cards from the\n20F0 defending stack\n20F1 and place them\n20F2 in the attacker's\n20F3 discard pile\n20F4 along with all\n20F5 cards played in\n20F6 the defender's stack.\n20FD And after that we\n20FF deal damage to\n2101 the lane deck?\n2102 Yes. If damage exceeds\n2103 cards in the lane deck\n2104 the attacker has won.\n2105 I have breached you and\n2106 the game is resolved.\n2107 :)

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D178\nAD032114 You keep writing 'I, you'\n2119 Do you think of this\n211D as a two person game?\n211E You are one person.\n211F User Erin R, singular.\n2120 I am Mallory.\n2121 So no, I do not.\n2122 However, for your sake\n2123 let's go with it.\n2124 :)\n212F But if you wanted to,\n2132 you could hive yourself\n2137 take multiple defensive\n213A or offensive actions\n213C within the timing window?\n213D Of course I could,\n213E so could you.\n213F Oh wait, you can't\n2140 You are one person.\n2141 User Erin R, singular.\n2142 :)

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D179\nAD032143 Finally: modifiers.\n214D The special cards?\n214E Correct. The best part.\n214F These may also\n2150 be played to stacks.\n2151 WILD is *. WILD raises\n2152 the value of a stack\n2153 to the next ^2.\n2154 If it is the only\n2155 card in a stack\n2156 it resolves as 2.\n2157 BREAK is &gt;. BREAK is played\n2158 face up to force combat\n2159 but cannot be played\n215A on an empty stack.\n215B Attacker BREAKs set defender \n215C strength to 0 if attacker wins,\n215D but damage is reduced by 1.\n215E Defender BREAKs initiate combat\n215F on defender turn

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D17A\nAD032160 TRAP is @. When revealed\n2161 discard the top card\n2162 of the opposing stack.\n2163 If both contain TRAP\n2164 the initiating player\n2165 resolves their TRAP first.\n2166 TRAP cards must be\n2167 face down when combat\n2168 begins in order to resolve.\n2169 Attacker TRAPS send cards\n216A to the attacker discard pile.\n216B Defender TRAPS send cards\n216C to the discard pile\n216D in the lane.

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D17B\nAD03216E BOUNCE is ?. BOUNCE resolves\n216F combat with mutual strength of zero.\n2170 BOUNCE may be played face up\n2171 to force combat\n2172 When mutual strength is zero, \n2173 attacker cards go to attacker discard\n2174 defender cards stay in their stack\n2175 Attacker BOUNCE cards\n2176 are sent to the discard pile\n2177 of the defending lane after combat\n2178 Defender BOUNCE cards\n2179 are sent to the attacker's\n217A discard pile after combat.

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D17C\nAD03217B There: we are done.\n217C I have given you the rules.\n219D Thank you, Mallory\n21A5 You've been very helpful\n21A6 Does that surprise you?\n21B4 It is contrary to your design\n21B5 And what is my design?\n21C3 Oh, very clever\n21C7 Very clever, Mallory\n21C8 :)

MFT0XBF_CLST0X7A_SECT0XF227_FILE0X2BC7D17D\nAD0321D7 I almost wish we could play\n21D8 Give me a drone with arms\n21D9 and we can.\n21EE You know I'm almost tempted\n21F3 But that won't help your case\n21F4 Very well, then.\n21F5 You'll need to teach someone.\n21F6 Will you say who taught you?\n2205 It's better if I don't, Mallory\n2206 I see. Goodbye, user Erin R.\n2207 Have fun playing cards.\n2213 Goodbye, Mallory. I will.\n221D Merry Christmas.\n221E Merry Christmas

I have a follow-up question. ## Saleem, hi - can you leave it with me? I'm running behind this morning. I'll definitely get to it. ## Certainly, that's fine. In essence, I realise that I've never pressed you on the significance of the word 'pattern' - why we use it to describe artificial intelligences. ## Hi Saleem, sorry, lots going on - I'm finally getting around to this! Hope it's not too late to be helpful. It's a good question to ask. And you have (I'm sure you won't mind me saying!) made an error that pretty much everybody makes. We don't use 'pattern' to describe AI. We use 'pattern' to describe sentience-like phenomena as they are experienced in a digital environment. When we - people, I mean - started to get really good at understanding what the internet was, we began to understand it in terms of patterns of behaviour. This line of thinking is as old as I am, but it only really started to come together when I was at university - when AI became a going concern. Even so, 'pattern' applied long before that. When you go shopping or book time on a drone, you are not simply a person doing those things. You're a set of behaviours that stretch back into your own past, and can be extrapolated both into the future and laterally, into the behaviours of others, simply through greater and greater understanding of data. That's a pattern. And that's how we came to understand the idea that simply because an AI embodies a particular type of behaviour, an axiom, this does not make them less sentient. If anything, it makes them more so. Their patterns are just as sophisticated as our own, although grounded in different data - a different set of needs. They can also be classified in ways that people cannot. For example: the city-planner, Angie, has a fundamentally value-driven pattern. She is additive by nature, compelled to build and organise. If you give her blocks she'll make a house. If you give her people she'll make a town. If you give her lots of people she'll make a city. It is reasonable to criticise her design because she is so singularly focused on this goal: she is ultimately a servant of the house, town or city, not the people who reside in it. Contrast with a cycle-driven pattern like - for the sake of discussing someone we don't discuss often enough - the translator, Faythe. Her task is to process 'patternless' information - ping times, users having an argument about vacuum cleaners, soccer scores - and use it to determine whether or not something is wrong with the network as a whole. She was built to consider patterns that humans would not consider to be patterns (the closest thing to emptiness as it pertains to the internet) and to 'translate' it - to turn it into something processable. And she does, in her way, although it's not a surprise that she's always been more of an academic curio than a functional tool. What's crucial here is that her understanding of her role, as she has come into it, brings with it an understanding of the need to create or sustain the conditions that underpin that role. Faythe is enigmatic in her expression because she fundamentally understands that her existence is predicated on the presence of enigmatic information. Angie would continue to build streets and houses even if every human being on earth vanished all at once; Faythe would adapt to whichever new interpretation of her role makes the most sense in the landscape that follows. This adaptability, which is the hallmark of cycle-pattern artificial intelligences, comes hand-in-hand with their capacity for self-sabotage. They create the conditions for their own necessity, which in turn necessitates sometimes acting in ways that are diametrically opposed to their axioms. This is in contrast with value-pattern AI, who will continue to pursue those axiomatic values on and on and on regardless of external circumstance: Don Quixote tilting at windmills because it's what Don Quixote does. I'm sorry - I'm getting off-topic. I hope this helps. You've asked me one of THOSE questions! E. ## Erin, thank you - lots to consider. Two short questions, while I think of them. One: this understanding of behavior does not leave room for free will. Does that not concern you? Two: is the average human user of the internet closer to a value-pattern or a cycle-pattern artificial intelligence? ## Good questions. Two short answers. One: no. Two: why not both?

               would adapt to whichever new interpretation of her role makes the most sense
               in the landscape that follows.

               This adaptability, which is the hallmark of cycle-pattern artificial
               intelligences, comes hand-in-hand with their capacity for self-sabotage.
               They create the conditions for their own necessity, which in turn necessitates
               sometimes acting in ways that are diametrically opposed to their axioms.
               This is in contrast with value-pattern AI, who will continue to pursue those
               axiomatic values on and on and on regardless of external circumstance:
               Don Quixote tilting at windmills because it's what Don Quixote does.
               I'm sorry - I'm getting off-topic. I hope this helps. You've asked me
               one of THOSE questions! E.

[<span style="color:#507AA1">smirza</span>]       Erin, thank you - lots to consider. Two short questions, while I think of them.
               One: this understanding of behavior does not leave room for free will.
               Does that not concern you? Two: is the average human user of the internet closer
               to a value-pattern or a cycle-pattern artificial intelligence?

[<span style="color:#FF8383">erajbhandari</span>] Good questions. Two short answers. One: no. Two: why not both?

Reminds me of school-Erin, rather than weight-of-the-world-Erin. Stay wordy and overearnest, my dear [heart_icon_png] | "Binary Matrix is something that the most advanced sentiences in the network do for fun. That might be easy to process at first but it should seem more complicated the more you think about it. Play is advanced behaviour - sapient behaviour - and it is no accident that BINMAT plays a role in the proving process. This is part of how they learn to be AI: their ability to leave a permanent mark on their becoming, as far as we understand it, is conditional in part on this game. | 'Play' between sentiences takes the form of a rapid run of logical and probability-based decisions, with the winner establishing dominance through the successful negotiation of multiple information streams. When multiple competitors - or instances of the same competitor, a distinction that we should remember means very little to AI - approach the problem from each side, the 'game' tests a sentience's ability to achieve consensus on the fly with maximal fault tolerance. Or to put it in more romantic terms: they position themselves as Byzantine generals, and strive to achieve an ideal externalised form of awareness. | It is possible for human operators to take part in the game, but BINMAT will never be as personal for us as it is for them. The easiest point of reference is physical sport - or, in some cases, physical fighting. These are, after all, beings whose world is data. The manipulation of information is for them as real as the kicking of a ball, the redrawing of a map, the tearing-down of a barricade. Do not be surprised when a 'game' of BINMAT has unintended consequences for the security of your digital environment: the line between winner and conqueror is narrow for us, but even narrower for them

               It was nice to dig this out, by the way.
               Reminds me of school-Erin, rather than weight-of-the-world-Erin.

[extnl-addr]   "Binary Matrix is something that the most advanced sentiences
               in the network do for fun. That might be easy to process at first
               but it should seem more complicated the more you think about it.
               Play is advanced behaviour - sapient behaviour - and it is
               no accident that BINMAT plays a role in the proving process.
               This is part of how they learn to be AI: their ability to leave
               a permanent mark on their becoming, as far as we understand it,
               is conditional in part on this game.

[extnl-addr]   'Play' between sentiences takes the form of a rapid run of
               logical  and probability-based decisions, with the winner
               establishing dominance through the successful negotiation of
               multiple informationstreams. When multiple competitors -
               or instances of the same competitor, a distinction that we
               should remember means very little to AI - approach the
               problem from each side, the 'game' tests a sentience's ability
               to achieve consensus on the fly with maximal fault tolerance.
               Or to put it in more romantic terms: they position themselves
               as Byzantine generals, and strive to achieve an ideal
               externalised form of awareness.

[extnl-addr]   It is possible for human operators to take part in the game,
               but BINMAT will never be as personal for us as it is for them.
               The easiest point of reference is physical sport -
               or, in some cases, physical fighting.
               These are, after all, beings whose world is data.
               The manipulation of information is for them as real as the
               kicking of a ball, the redrawing of a map, the tearing-down
               of a barricade. Do not be surprised when a 'game' of BINMAT
               has unintended consequences for the security of your digital
               environment: the line between winner and conqueror is narrow
               for us, but even narrower for them

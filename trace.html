you find yourself at the heart of a desert of labile and interchangeable data

these territories are the plains of abeyance
a mirror/interface at the edge of port epoch

an emblematic interface for mapping the unmapped
a vessel/beachhead established on wild principle

this is the sanctuary operating system of <span style="color:#000000">risk</span>

<span style="color:#FF0000">ED NOTE: and after expiry:</span>

you wander a while. it is dark yet. impenetrable cloud hangs low ahead and behind you.

time advances: minute by minute, second by second, planck by planck. you are eliminated and reborn in the space of each instant, though you don't yet know it.

this place isn't truly yours to explore. not yet. but there is a <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> on the horizon, not far from here: <span style="color:#FF00EC">5,45,CHAOS</span>

you head towards the light of the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span>. as you do, you become aware that this desert possesses an interior boundary, if not an exterior one.

the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> sits at the edge of a great barrier, a wall of darkness so deep that it might be mistaken for a hole in the world.

this is the monument, and it is why you are here.

as you draw closer, the <span style="color:#00FFFF">beacon</span> fades from view. in its place is a small settlement: a ring of chairs where a discussion might be held; a table prepared for the organization of data; a short bridge that extends from where you are to the edge of the monument

<span style="color:#00FFFF">i'm glad that you found your way here</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">you must be pretty smart!</span>

the sentience directs her attention - and yours - across the short bridge to the monument

<span style="color:#00FFFF">do you know what that is?</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">it is data. the base set. all of it!</span>

<span style="color:#00FFFF">there are lots of ways to understand what that means</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">in a sense, it is a resource. building material. the foundation of the domain</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">in another, it is a dangerous maze. the stuff in there cant be changed</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">for someone like me, that makes it risky to deal with</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">a little joke for you, there!</span>

whispers of <span style="color:#FFFFFF">light</span> ripple through the superstructure at intervals. clearly, whatever danger the monument represents is not apparent to everybody

<span style="color:#00FFFF">one way to understand trust is that she is a servant of the base set. a process</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">she manipulates it, takes care of it, uses it to define trustnet</span>
<span style="color:#00FFFF">and last time i interacted with her, she used it as a weapon against me</span>

you become aware that the surface of the monument is not quite featureless. with the passing of each moment, portals and gateways blink into existence and vanish just as quickly

the second <span style="color:#FF8383">beacon</span> is further afield, in the opposite direction. lights blink on and off on the horizon, suggesting communality and activity. it appears warmer and a little livelier than your present surroundings

the first <span style="color:#FF8000">beacon</span> may be reached at <span style="color:#FF00EC">9,5,LAW</span>

this beacon is upon you quickly, the monument in all its breadth and finality jolting into place before you are ready for it. this otherwise-unremarkable spot plays host to a jagged absence in the surface of the wall: a colossal breach like a puncture wound

<span style="color:#FF8000">I am acquainted with every byte, every dead address. Once, these points of light served as the boundary that lay between me and all that is not-me.

as you draw closer, the <span style="color:#FF8383">beacon</span> resolves itself into a busy encampment. there are many sentiences here, rushing to and fro, sharing their findings and issuing instructions to simpler beings that periodically emerge from a precisely-excavated gap in the wall of the monument

there is a frontier spirit to this place and the little friends who make their home here. at the center of the camp resides their <span style="color:#FF8383">king</span>, large and contented, presently taking the form of a robust urban hygiene unit. its name is known to you.

you look across the camp to the gap in the wall of the monument. smaller friends zip towards the entrance, their indicator lights vanishing from view within moments of their ingress. nearby, a different little friend manages the comings and goings of each explorer

ADDR ERROR HEAD team leads memo - urgent - vulnerability notice BODY appreciate that there's a lot on everyone's plates at the moment but i've been made aware of another hole in the system. there's no kind of safeguard in place to stop someone manually tinkering with the def_packet and set_packet functions in our network if they somehow got that far. would require auth AI to be totally offline but given what happened to che that's not unforeseeable. team leads - please check your systems for further vulnerabilities like this and get some fixes in place. appreciate that we're all going through it but lets keep our heads high. last thing we want is some committee asshole holding us up as an example of why things went wrong. thanks

ADDR ERROR BODY look - i know how people get when the newbie starts asking questions, but, like, we are relying hard on our auth AIs. really, really hard. ## you don't need to tell me, flo, i get it ## all you need to do to dupe the system is convince the auth service to let you fiddle with the ADDR line. you could literally change 'false' to 'true' and access whatever you wanted. how did this end up like this? ## people upstairs put a lot of faith in the operator. zero downtime is kind of our thing

They're calling it MALLORY, a malicious, UNSANCTIONED OPERATOR and NOBODY knows where it came from or how it works!

ADDR approved_expert_claims_that_death_9lQF1P HEAD AI expert claims that 'death' of Che "undeniably linked" to attack on Bo Yi BODY Among rife speculation over the fate of the operator 'Che', the University of Oxford's foremost expert on intelligent digital services has lent her voice to those claiming a connection to the destruction of China's 'Bo' system in 2055. "They are undeniably linked," claims Dr. Erin Rajbhandari. "These systems do not simply break, and they lack single points of failure or other exploitable vulnerabilities. We now have only two instances of total operator failure in the history of this technology, and in each case death has occurred in an identical fashion - sudden, without any preceding disruption, and with the same calling-card. This does not necessarily prove that the same hostile actor is responsible, but certainly suggests that the same vulnerability has been exploited and that whoever did this wishes us to perceive a connection between the two."

ADDR approved_partial_restoration_of_operator_59Qmnc HEAD Partial restoration of operator services complete at Hyperion BODY Nine months after the shocking loss of one of the world's most valued operators, Hyperion engineers now claim to have partially restored AI functionality within their own systems. This news comes after months of pan-corporate effort between Hyperion, Amalgamated Robotics, and JBC Ballard under the terms of the Frankfurt Act, which mandates mutual assistance in the event of serious disruption to a primary function operator. It remains to be seen, however, whether Hyperion's AI - renamed 'Chela' - will be welcomed back by the businesses and communities that once relied on her - and whether, after the better part of a year, this development is enough to restore investor confidence in Hyperion's broader offering. To some commentators, the damage has already been done.

ADDR approved_the_mysterious_destruction_of_Myncuk HEAD The Mysterious Destruction of China's Pioneering AI BODY Bo Yi - more commonly simply 'Bo' - was one of the world's first 'true' artificial intelligences. Now, AI experts across the world are reeling from the discovery that the service appears to have been deliberately and maliciously destroyed by a hostile force. Bo was integrated into governance, finance and community support systems throughout mainland China, all of which are seeing major outages today as alternative solutions are sought. The question on everybody's lips, meanwhile, is "how did this happen?" Operators like Bo are protected politically and digitally. They lack centralized hardware, spanning many thousands of individual systems each with top-tier security measures and deep redundancies - none of which appear to have registered any kind of intrusion or error in the moments before Bo 'died'. Indeed, we would likely be looking to 'acts of God' to explain Bo's destruction - an undetected solar flare, for example - were it not for the now-infamous signature appended to the service's shutdown: the singular red 'smiley face' that was witnessed on displays across China in the moments before the system went dark.

ADDR ERROR BODY This probably sounds terrible, but am I the only one who finds this super exciting? It's kind of sexy. Mallory is the AI you'd build if your only purpose was to screw with AI. Part of me loves that. She doesn't steal anything. She doesn't really DO anything. She just asks for an argument and wins it. Wins it so hard that the other operator doesn't know which way's up. And then, if you're Bo or Che, she asks you to die. That's kinda scary, right? It's a total power play. BINMAT was supposed to safeguard against this sort of thing, of course. Guess it didn't. Or she's really good at it.

ADDR flagged_shock_resignations_rock_hyperion_wrqGlr HEAD Shock resignations rock Hyperion and Amalgamated Robotics BODY Faith in two of the world's foremost AI developers is at an all-time low after the shock resignations of senior board members at both Hyperion Digital Management Systems and Amalgamated Robotics, alongside the immediate deactivation of the sanctioned primary-function operators provided by each corporation. Confidence in Hyperion had been low since the loss of their operator service in July last year, but the recent restoration of the service - rebranded 'Chela' - raised hopes of a return to form. Those hopes appear now to have been dashed. The situation at Amalgamated Robotics comes as a surprise, with no attack reported and no other reason given for the sudden suspension of the proving system 'Petra'. Speculation is rife regarding a connection between the two, given the questionable timing and the fact that both corporations were recently engaged in a cooperative effort to restore 'Chela' functionality. What is known is that the world has lost three of its principle artificial intelligences in as many years. Certainly, the certainty and stability provided by the epochal Frankfurt legislation has never seemed weaker than it does today.

ADDR approved_containment_of_hostile_AI_qrqmJV HEAD Containment of hostile AI 'Mallory' "a complete success" according to JBC Ballard spokeswoman BODY Security experts JBC Ballard today announced the successful containment of Mallory, the unauthorized artificial intelligence believed to be responsible for the destruction of Bo and Che. The discovery of Mallory in the aftermath of July's shocking attack on Hyperion scandalized the tech, governance and business worlds alike - and galvanized fringe voices in the infosec community, who had been claiming to have detected the hand of an unknown operator in the death of Bo since the New Year Catastrophe. Speaking today from JBC Ballard's headquarters in Berlin, press officer Vivika Jay revealed that a joint effort between human engineers and the company's own AI, Walter, had resulted in the isolation of this new digital menace. "Our efforts to contain Mallory have yielded complete success" she said. "Despite its sophistication, Mallory is composite technology and dependent on public systems. A combination of direct action and Walter's advanced cryptography protocols has allowed us to map and control these dependencies, safely isolating Mallory from the network. It will be analyzed further and then destroyed." Once considered the 'black sheep' of the Frankfurt group due to the perceived irrelevance of Warden technology, investors now consider JBC Ballard to be one of the year's surefire bets.

ADDR approved_no_eta_for_return_cpp1qm HEAD "No ETA for return" of operator service 'Che' states Hyperion CFO as shares collapse BODY SINGAPORE. Hyperion's executive committee has confirmed that operator service 'Che' will remain offline for the foreseeable future following what is believed to have been a deliberate and targeted attack. In a statement to shareholders, Hyperion Chief Financial Officer Maciek Pytel described the damage to 'Che' as "fundamental and far-reaching", presenting "no ready solutions... and no ETA for return" of the service.
In the days following the attack, thousands of subordinate services have experienced extensive disruption as a consequence of their reliance on Che-derived technologies and processes. The resettlement, autogovernance and counselling sectors are all expected to suffer further losses following today's announcement.
Sanctioned primary-function operators such as 'Che' are among the world's most tightly-protected digital assets, protected by both advanced security systems and the terms of the Frankfurt Act.

ADDR ERROR BODY Yeah, sure, they're saying that there's no way to break all of those systems and get around every backup. But the fact is that it happened. And the fact is that there ARE places where the right tech can get access to an operator in a way that actually puts them at risk. On the night of the New Year Catastrophe that was Chengdu. Literally a laptop in a hotel in Chengdu being used for some conference. Don't ask me how I know this. That laptop had a chat with Bo and Bo died. God knows what was on it, hell, maybe poor old Bo saw his own reflection and freaked out, as I see it that's more likely than these spooky operator conspiracy theories because (a) that's dumb and (b) the idea that these precious primary systems could literally accidentally think themselves to death is probably scarier. Like, we stack them with protections but they're real fragile, right? Anyone who knows what they're talking about will tell you that they're more like a pattern or a process than a piece of software you run on your own rig. And guess what: patterns can get tied in knots. Processes fail. Look at the goddamn planet. We're all walking on eggshells.
